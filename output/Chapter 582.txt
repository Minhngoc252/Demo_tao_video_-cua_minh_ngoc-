Boom! Jerome crashed into the fortress, slamming into the ground with tremendous force. The black beam left a path of destruction, obliterating everything it touched. Soldiers caught in its trajectory were annihilated, their bodies exploding from the impact. The shifting form of Gatros let out a sinister laugh. "Kehehehe… I feel like a god. I should have awakened this power long ago…." Because of Ghislain’s efforts, the Salvation Order had found itself in a dire situation. They were forced to hastily open the Rifts and incite rebellions across nations, far earlier than planned. The entire continent had become their enemy. Still, Gatros had been confident of victory. The Salvation Order possessed more transcendent individuals than any kingdom. But after suffering defeat in Ruthania, Gatros realized his arrogance had been a grave mistake. The emergence of extraordinary individuals—warriors who could overpower multiple priests—had tipped the scales. And the number of such warriors within the Allied Forces was steadily growing. As the situation worsened, Gatros deliberated. "How can we stand against such powerful opponents?" He, once the aggressor, now found himself in the position of the challenged. During the civil war in Ruthania, Gatros had learned a harsh lesson: no matter how strong he was, he couldn’t contend with absolute powers like the Guardian of the World Tree or the Saintess of War. Facing even two such figures guaranteed defeat. Even the White Lion, Gillian, was a match he couldn’t win in a one-on-one battle. In this predicament, Gatros found inspiration in the actions of Helgenique. "It must have been possible by using all the power of the orbs." The Atrodé forces had closely observed the Allied Forces’ movements. It was said that the strongest members of the Allied Forces had joined forces to take down Helgenique. But using the orbs in such a way ultimately led to death. Gatros had pondered this limitation and devised a different approach. "What if the power could be harnessed safely from outside?" Only two orbs remained, and their power couldn’t be squandered. Instead, Gatros began experimenting, gradually extracting energy from the priests whenever he had the chance. Rather than absorbing all the energy at once, he devised a method to create an energy-filled space that could be utilized externally. The results were astonishing. The power far exceeded that of a single transcendent. It required no risk since he could absorb energy from the surrounding space and expend it immediately. The only prerequisites were exceptional skill and mental fortitude to control the immense energy. "This is it! With this power, I can challenge even greater transcendent beings!" The concentrated energy granted unimaginable strength, incomparable to the fragmented power held by individual priests. Of course, this method wasn’t without penalties. The priests had to deplete their own energy to form the space. But Gatros didn’t care. If the situation called for this power, the priests wouldn’t be of much use anyway. What mattered was overwhelming, unrivaled strength—one force to dominate all. "The divine has shown me the way once more." Gatros was the genius who had revived the Salvation Order, deciphering its scriptures and restoring its power. It was no surprise that such a man could create a new method of wielding power. Moreover, he was the only one capable of controlling this energy with such precision. Gatros surveyed the fortress, his malevolent smile widening. "Kehehe… To think I’d have to use this power before even meeting the Ruthania army…." He could have captured the fortress without resorting to this power, but leaving Jerome unchecked would have delayed the operation. The Atrodé forces were already at a disadvantage. Dragging the battle out would increase the likelihood of being surrounded. Jerome, a formidable transcendent himself, needed to be subdued quickly. Using this power was the only option. "Even taking down the most troublesome one is a victory… This too must be the will of the divine…." Whirrr… Around Gatros’ form, the black energy began to gather again. The mist that had spread across the battlefield now condensed rapidly. The sight sapped what little morale the Allied soldiers had left. "It’s over… We’re already in hell…." "The goddess has abandoned us…." "This is a nightmare… It must be a nightmare…." Even Jerome, their greatest hope, had been struck down in an instant. The soldiers could do nothing but drop their weapons and tremble in terror. Gatros found their fear utterly satisfying. Smirking, he spoke. "Witness the power of the great divine and perish." Zap! Another black beam shot out. This destructive force would obliterate the fortress and annihilate the soldiers in its path. But the situation unfolded differently this time. Flash! A golden barrier materialized along the path of the black beam. Crack! Crackle! The beam clashed violently with the barrier but failed to penetrate it. Not a single soldier perished. It was a barrier imbued with immense mana. The colossal form of Gatros tilted its head slightly. "That one still…." Whoosh! A golden streak shot up from the fortress, piercing the darkened sky. The glowing figure was Jerome. His body radiated light, though blood trickled from his lips, and his tattered robe flapped in the wind. Yet his eyes burned with fierce determination. "It’s not over yet." Jerome extended his arms, unleashing a surge of mana. Whirr—! Whirr—! Whirr—! Brilliant magical circles began to form in the air. Twenty in total. Each one was infused with overwhelming power, moving as if alive and resonating with one another. The energy emanating from the circles vibrated through the air, and the waves rippled far and wide. Rumble! Golden lightning bolts erupted from the magical circles. Zap! Zap! Zap! The massive bolts tore through the black mist, piercing it. Sizzle! Each strike burned the mist, causing it to dissipate. The black energy was slowly diminishing. Gatros’ expression twisted with anger. "You dare…!" Black energy surged around him, swirling like a storm as it sought to engulf Jerome. Jerome thrust his hands forward, conjuring a golden barrier. Boom! The black energy clashed against the barrier, producing thunderous roars. The ground quaked, and the sky seemed to split apart. Jerome gritted his teeth. "I have to reduce the energy while nullifying it." This energy couldn’t be absorbed. He had experienced this firsthand during his battle with Helgenique. Even if absorption was possible, the sheer volume of energy would make it uncontrollable. The enemy wouldn’t simply stand by and let him regroup. Jerome had no choice but to fight with everything he had. Whirr—! Golden magical circles glowed in Jerome’s eyes, radiating brilliant light. This battle was unlike his encounter with Helgenique. Back then, he had reserved his strength for a prolonged fight. Now, there was no room for such caution. To protect the fortress, Jerome was prepared to die. Fortunately, thanks to the Allied mages, the suppression of his mana was minimal. He had to end the fight before they were exhausted. "As quickly as possible!" Boom! For the first time, Jerome fully unleashed all his mana at once. Blinding rays of light erupted from his hands, writhing like living beings as they surged toward Gatros. Bang! Bang! Bang! Gatros, a form composed entirely of energy, wasn’t physically harmed. But each hit caused the black mist to dissipate slightly, the remaining energy struggling to fill the gaps. The range of the black fog began to shrink. Gatros smirked, though his expression was strained. While much of the energy had been eradicated, far more remained. "Do you really think you can withstand this transcendent power?" Black energy burst forth from Gatros’ massive form. His and Jerome’s energies collided in the air. Boom! Boom! Boom! Hundreds of golden lightning bolts clashed with black flashes, filling the sky with their explosive fury. Each collision sent shockwaves that shook Jerome to his core. The soldiers, both allied and enemy, watched in stunned silence. This was no ordinary battle. It was a fight between gods. Unlike any other transcendent, Jerome—an 8th-circle mage—fought on a scale unmatched by others. But Jerome’s condition was deteriorating. "Ugh…." Blood trickled from his clenched mouth. Gatros wielded the combined energy of six priests. Four of them had retreated, having expended nearly all their energy, but the strength they had contributed was undeniable. Their energy, while lacking finesse, was undoubtedly at the level of a transcendent. Combined with Gatros’ own formidable power, it created an overwhelming force. No matter how strong Jerome was, it was impossible to endure against such concentrated energy for long. Boom! Boom! Boom! Each time Jerome blocked an attack, his body was forced back. His precarious state was evident to all. Victory seemed unattainable. If this continued, death was inevitable. "But I have to do it!" If he fell, everyone in the fortress would die. Jerome resolved to push himself further. He despised the idea of dying, but he had no choice. There was one method he could attempt, something only possible with his remaining mana. Rumble… Jerome began to focus all of his unleashed mana into a single point. Gatros, sensing that his opponent was preparing something significant, reacted immediately. Enormous tentacles of black energy erupted from his form, lashing out in all directions to entangle and restrain Jerome. At that moment, golden feathers of light scattered from Jerome's body. He soared swiftly into the air, deftly evading the tentacles, even as he continued to gather his mana. "Just a little more… Please, just a little more…." The mana was nearly fully concentrated. The complex formulas Jerome had been calculating in his mind were complete. All that remained was to activate the spell. Yet, he hesitated. "If I cast this… I’ll die…" A creeping fear began to take hold of his heart, a primal instinct whispering of the impending end. This spell was a forbidden one. Even Jerome himself had never used it before. His master, who had taught him the spell’s formula, had also issued a grave warning. "This is a secret technique of our tower, but… don’t ever use it until you’ve reached the 9th circle. Even at the 9th circle, casting it will cost your life." "What happens if I use it before then?" Jerome had asked. "You’ll die, obviously." "What if I absolutely have to use it in an emergency?" "Then you’ll take your opponent down with you." This spell was designed with a specific purpose in mind—to face an insurmountable foe. Because of that, Jerome’s master had spoken of it lightly, assuming there would never be a situation dire enough to warrant its use. With Jerome’s skill, he should have been able to escape even the strongest opponents. "You hate pain and dying, don’t you? Just run if you face someone stronger." "Of course. I’d never use this spell. Haha!" Jerome had agreed. Why would anyone use a spell that guaranteed death if their skill level wasn’t high enough? It seemed absurd. But now, the situation left him no choice. If he fled… all those people… Boom! Boom! Boom! Jerome glanced back as Gatros' relentless attacks pushed him higher into the air. Everyone was staring at him with terror in their eyes. Their hope rested entirely on him, and the weight of their expectations crushed him. Jerome’s resolve wavered. "Maybe… we could all run away together…." But could they truly escape from this monster? That destructive power could annihilate the entire fortress in an instant. Gatros was stronger now than Helgenique in his berserk state. Even Ghislain or Julien couldn’t defeat him. This was power on the verge of transcendence. "I have to survive. Only then can I join forces with others to bring this monster down…" There were many powerful transcendents in the Ruthania army. Together, they might find a way to defeat him. Yes, that was the logical and efficient choice. But even as he reached this conclusion, Jerome’s heart trembled violently. "I should retreat… hold him off for a bit longer…" If he stopped fighting even for a moment, Gatros' attacks would target the fortress. Even with Jerome doing his best to shield them, countless lives would be lost. Gatros would never let the Allied Forces retreat easily. Having unleashed this power, he would seek to weaken their forces further, no matter the cost. Boom! Boom! Boom! Each time Jerome blocked an attack, he was hurled through the air. Even defending and dodging were becoming increasingly difficult. "What should I do…." If he used any more mana, he wouldn’t even have the strength to execute his final move. His only option would be to flee alone. He had to decide now. Jerome, his eyes filled with fatigue, looked at Gatros. The enormous, writhing energy of the monster continued to radiate unending power. "It’s so strong." How many more lives would it take to bring down this beast? If they lost the fortress and the Atrodé forces advanced, how many others would die? Suddenly, Jerome remembered something Alfoy had often said while they worked together in the mobile workshop. "Magic isn’t about circles; it’s about real-world use. You know, nobody would miss you if you were gone, right? They’ve done fine without you before." The memory brought a faint smile to Jerome’s lips. "Yeah… they’ll be fine without me." If he could just eliminate this monster, the Allied Forces would undoubtedly win the war. If he could just destroy Gatros, others could retreat safely. No—if he used this forbidden spell, he might even wipe out the Atrodé forces entirely, ending the war in one decisive stroke. Jerome clenched his teeth, steeling his resolve. "If I sacrifice myself… I can save so many others and end this war!" Whirrr… Jerome raised both hands high above his head, fully committing. High in the sky, a massive magical circle began to form. And it wasn’t just one. Dozens, then hundreds of circles appeared, connecting and intertwining. Tremendous mana surged toward Gatros. "Ugh… What is this…?" Gatros looked up in disbelief. This force, powerful enough to exert tangible pressure even on a transcendent being like himself, was unlike anything he had faced. Whoosh… The magical circles radiated brilliant light, forming an intricate pattern that seemed to encapsulate the very laws of the universe. The design was breathtaking, an interwoven tapestry of complexity and mystery that defied description. Everyone who witnessed it, both ally and foe, was filled with awe. Even the enemy mages ceased their magic and stared, their gazes fixed on the heavens. Whirrr… At last, the magical circles were complete. From their center, an intense golden light erupted outward. "Aaaaargh!" Gatros howled in agony as the light engulfed him. The energy seemed to bypass everything else, rapidly depleting his black mist. But it wasn’t over. Boom! Suddenly, the magical circles split open, revealing a cosmic landscape. Countless stars, galaxies, and nebulae appeared, a celestial display that transcended human comprehension. It was as though the boundary between reality and illusion had dissolved, presenting an otherworldly spectacle of absolute wonder. The sight shook the souls of all who beheld it. This was not just an astonishing display; it was an experience that redefined existence itself. Jerome, blood streaming from his mouth, slowly opened his lips to speak. "Judgment of Radiance." At last, the spell was complete. And from the majestic celestial expanse— Rumble… Rumble… Rumble… A massive golden meteor began its descent.
