Baron Shear trembled uncontrollably, biting his nails. In truth, no one else suspected anything or even doubted Ghislain. To them, he was simply a seasoned and skilled soldier who had joined their ranks. But as a conspirator, Baron Shear couldn’t afford such casual thoughts. "Why couldn’t he just stay quiet? Why is he trying so hard?" While others were oblivious, Shear couldn’t shake his anxiety. Count Fenris might have the skill to escape if things went wrong, but Shear didn’t. "If we’re caught, I’ll be the one to die!" Mocking Shear’s fears, the Dougly Squad charged forward with unrelenting energy. Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! "Push harder!" At Ghislain’s command, the squad gritted their teeth and swung their clubs with everything they had. As exhausting as the fight was, the punishment they’d face if they lost was even scarier. Determined not to fail, they fought as if their lives depended on it. "Charge! Keep going!" The Dougly Squad’s fierce efforts inspired the other soldiers, who began tearing into the enemy formation with newfound vigor. The Fifth Infantry Company’s formation broke completely at the center. Caught off guard, they panicked. Having never encountered such a situation, they had no idea how to respond. The Fifth Company commander could only shout useless orders in desperation. "Hold the line! Reform the formation! Don’t let them through!" Easier said than done. The chaos caused by the Dougly Squad at the center made it impossible for the soldiers to regroup. Anyone who tried was struck down by the squad’s relentless attacks, while the rest of the Third Company surged forward and overwhelmed the distracted Fifth Company. "We’re winning! Push harder!" "Break through! Don’t stop!" Someone shouted, and the soldiers surged forward with even greater intensity. Caught up in the momentum, they charged recklessly ahead. The Third Infantry Company commander couldn’t hide his joy, laughing triumphantly. "We’re winning! We’re actually winning!" Just a bit more effort, and it would be over. The enemy’s formation was already split and crumbling. Surely, the observers would agree. The Third Company commander turned to Baron Shear, his face glowing with pride. "What do you think? Those are my men out there! We’re winning this!" "…Yes, it seems so." Unlike the commander, who was brimming with excitement as he pointed at Ghislain, Baron Shear could only sweat nervously. "Please, just stop this madness already…" Why was Ghislain going so far? Why was he charging ahead like this, looking like he was actually enjoying himself? In truth, Ghislain _was_ enjoying himself. "Come on! Just a little more effort!" He had deliberately sealed his mana and even restricted his recovery abilities. Every movement made his body ache, and sweat poured from him in torrents. This kind of training—pushing himself to the limits of his endurance—was always thrilling. Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! The soldiers following him were exhausted, but strangely, they felt invigorated. For the first time, they were experiencing the rush of battle. For men who had always been on the losing side, this was a fresh, exhilarating experience. The energy was infectious. Even the other soldiers felt the rush of victory. Overwhelming their opponents for the first time, they fought with everything they had. "Let’s go! Push harder!" "Yeah! Let’s do this!" Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! The Fifth Infantry Company’s formation was now completely shattered. The Third Infantry Company soldiers pushed through with their clubs swinging fiercely. Eventually, the Dougly Squad broke through the enemy formation entirely and raced toward the designated high ground. The Fifth Company commander, his face pale, shouted desperately. "Stop them! Hold the line! Don’t let them take it!" The Third Infantry Company had long been considered the weakest unit. Losing to them would be a permanent humiliation. But the Fifth Infantry Company couldn’t stop the Dougly Squad. Their morale was crushed, and their formation was in shambles. Any attempts to counterattack were quickly thwarted by the relentless advance of the Third Company. Ghislain stood atop the hill and shouted loudly. "Now hold the line!" Reaching the high ground was only part of the mission. They had to defend against the enemy’s counterattack to complete the objective. The difference lay in whether they could decisively suppress the enemy or just barely hold on. Before the Third Company commander could issue an order, Ghislain had already given the command. But the commander, too caught up in the excitement, didn’t notice. "Haha! They’re doing exactly as we trained!" That was all he thought. Following Ghislain’s orders, the soldiers who had broken through quickly transitioned into a defensive formation. The Fifth Infantry Company soldiers tried desperately to retake the high ground, but it was a futile effort. The morale and momentum were entirely in the Third Company’s favor. The Fifth Company soldiers were exhausted and had no strength left to fight. The few who tried were swiftly struck down, adding to the growing pile of fallen comrades. The observers and referees watching the exercise exchanged glances and nodded. "There’s no need to watch any further." "The Third Infantry Company is the clear winner." "Let’s conclude the evaluation." When the result was announced, the Fifth Infantry Company commander’s face fell as if the sky had collapsed. The Third Infantry Company soldiers threw their clubs into the air and cheered loudly. "We did it!" "We actually won!" "The Dougly Squad is the best!" Having never won a tactical evaluation before, the soldiers were overwhelmed with emotion. Even the Third Company commander was on the verge of tears. Thanks to the Dougly Squad, they had finally achieved their long-desired victory—the first in their military careers. "We won… We finally won… Our first win ever!" Overcome with joy, the commander grabbed Baron Shear’s hand tightly. "The man you recommended is incredible! You said he’s someone you knew from your hometown, right?" "Y-Yes, that’s correct." "Thank you! This is all thanks to you!" "Th-Thank you… Congratulations." Baron Shear’s pale face and trembling hands didn’t go unnoticed by the commander, who tilted his head curiously. "Are you alright?" "I-I just… caught a bit of a fever…" "Oh no! You need to take care of yourself. I’ll send you some medicine right away!" "Y-Yes, thank you. I’ll take my leave now." "Of course! Rest well!" Baron Shear staggered away, feeling as though his heart would explode. All he wanted was for Count Fenris to start behaving himself. But Ghislain had no intention of granting that wish. His goal was nothing less than first place. The subsequent battles against other companies played out in much the same way. "Charge!" At the Third Company commander’s shout, the soldiers charged forward. His sole tactic was to order an all-out assault. But paired with Ghislain, that strategy produced extraordinary results. Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! "Ahhh! What the hell are these guys?!" Wherever the Dougly Squad led the charge, no one could stand against them. Ordinary infantry simply couldn’t withstand soldiers who had endured Ghislain’s brutal training. No matter the situation—offense or defense—theDougly Squad dominated the battlefield. With every victory, the Third Infantry Company’s momentum grew, and so did their reputation. “Dougly! Dougly!” “The Dougly Squad is unstoppable!” “We’re victorious!” The morale of the Third Infantry Company had reached its peak. Winning streaks were great on their own, but the soldiers were particularly motivated by the celebratory meat and alcohol that followed each victory. The Third Company commander muttered to himself with a nostalgic expression. “Who would’ve thought we’d come this far…” Initially, he thought winning just one match would be enough, but they had won every single one. Now, with just one more company left to defeat, they could claim first place in the tactical evaluations. The idea of their unit, forever last in rank, taking first place seemed almost too good to be true. Suddenly, a sense of fear washed over him. “My talent… It’s terrifying.” He was completely mistaken. Convinced that his own hidden talent had finally blossomed, he began fantasizing about a future where he might rise to the rank of corps commander. The man who had sparked this delusion, Ghislain, had now become the hero of the Third Infantry Company. Ghislain, hands on his hips, shouted to the soldiers behind him. “Are you ready?!” “Yes!” Victory today would mean securing first place. Energized and determined, the soldiers shouted back with all their might. Though Ghislain wasn’t even their superior officer, he had somehow managed to command the entire unit. Of course, the camaraderie forged during the post-victory celebrations—often punctuated by drunken brawls—played no small part in this. Restless and full of confidence from their winning streak, the soldiers swung their arms and legs as if warming up. Their self-assurance had grown so much that it practically overflowed. Soon, the solemn command of the Third Company commander rang out. “Charge!” “Waaaaaaaah!” Led by Ghislain, the entire unit surged forward. The ferocious momentum of their charge caused the opposing Ninth Infantry Company to grit their teeth and steel their expressions. As the weakest unit in the Second Corps, the Ninth Company couldn’t afford to lose to the perpetual losers of the Third Company. The Ninth Company commander was just as desperate for victory. “Do not let them through! Hold the line! Stop them at all costs!” Among the other company commanders, the Third Company commander was a constant target of disdain. A rural bumpkin with no skill, who had bribed his way into the position, he was nothing more than an eyesore. And yet, these same commanders were now watching their units get crushed by him. It was a humiliation they couldn’t accept. “Hold them back!” Thwack! The Ninth Infantry Company commander screamed orders, but it was no use. As Ghislain tripped one soldier and swung his club, the frontline was immediately breached. “Waaaaah!” Through the gap Ghislain created, the Third Infantry Company soldiers poured in like a flood. It was the same strategy as always, and everyone knew it was coming, yet they couldn’t stop it. Ghislain’s skills were maddeningly effective. Ultimately, the Dougly Squad broke through the wall of the Ninth Infantry Company with overwhelming force. Once the central line of an infantry formation is pierced, it’s over. The breach allows enemy soldiers to pour in endlessly, collapsing the entire structure. Victor, his face flushed with excitement as he followed Ghislain, laughed loudly. “Pwahaha! We’re the strongest!” Hearing this, the other soldiers let out triumphant cheers. “Waaaaah! We’re the strongest!” No one could stop this momentum. The Ninth Infantry Company was swiftly overwhelmed by the Third Infantry Company, who charged forward like madmen. The soldiers surged through the gap Ghislain had created, completely dismantling the formation of the Ninth Company. The Ninth Infantry Company commander mumbled in shock, his face blank. “W-What is this…? How are we falling apart so easily?” In moments like this, the proper response is to quickly reposition the soldiers and reform the defensive line. But the commander lacked the capability, and his soldiers weren’t trained for such maneuvers. In the end, the Dougly Squad charged forward and successfully secured the high ground. The evaluators watching the exercise nodded in approval. “There’s no need to watch any further.” “Every time I see them, I’m impressed. Especially by that ‘Dougly Squad.’” “The company commander has done an excellent job training them.” The other soldiers had simply been riding on the momentum created by the Dougly Squad, but the decisive results made it look like the entire company was exceptionally well-trained. The evaluation was complete, and the soldiers who had secured the high ground erupted in joy. “Yaaaaah!” “We won again!” “The undefeated company!” Everyone knew exactly who was responsible for their success. They all turned to look at Ghislain. One soldier grabbed the Third Infantry Company’s flag and handed it to Ghislain. Naturally, Ghislain took the flag, planted it on the high ground, and shouted. “We’ve won! We’re number one!” “Waaaaah!” The cheers echoed so loudly it felt as if the sky might fall. For the soldiers, the idea that their perpetually last-ranked company was now in first place was unbelievable. It was all thanks to the Dougly Squad. “The Dougly Squad is the best!” “Dougly! Dougly! Dougly!” As the soldiers chanted endlessly, they lifted Ghislain into the air and began tossing him in celebration. Ghislain laughed as he was thrown into the air. “Hahaha!” After all, any army under his command had to win. The thrill of battle and the joy of victory were… “Wait! Why am I enjoying this so much?!” Ghislain suddenly snapped back to his senses. Truth be told, this war game was quite fun, but he had allowed himself to get too caught up in it. Perhaps it was because it had been a while since he personally trained low-ranking soldiers. Raising common soldiers felt different from training knights. “Well… since the time and location haven’t been decided yet, this should be fine.” If he had to wait anyway, why not enjoy the process? With that thought, Ghislain decided to let it go. For taking first place in the tactical evaluations, the soldiers of the Third Infantry Company received massive rewards. Everyone was given prize money, and an abundance of meat and alcohol was distributed to them. The Third Infantry Company commander even dug into his own pockets to provide more food and drink. “Eat up! Eat as much as you want! Keep that charging spirit alive! And the Dougly Squad gets extra!” He was overjoyed. Now, no one could look down on him anymore. To show his gratitude, he handed extra money to the Dougly Squad, praising them profusely. The soldiers, who had endured poor rations for so long, ate and drank their fill, finally feeling satisfied. “Hahaha! This is all thanks to the Dougly Squad leader.” “He’s great at fighting and even better at leading charges!” “And the Dougly Squad members have become incredibly strong!” Victor and the other squad members beamed with pride at the compliments. They had never experienced such recognition or achieved such results before. “Man, training was brutal, but…” “Now I see why it’s worth it.” “This feels amazing! I want to keep hearing this praise forever!” “The Dougly Squad leader is the best! The best!” They had finally discovered the joy of combat and victory. While everyone was celebrating, one soldier approached Ghislain. “Dougly Squad leader, the royal secretary has arrived to see you.” “Ah, is that so?” Laughing and chatting with the soldiers, Ghislain stood up. It seemed some news had finally arrived. In the commander’s office, Baron Shear waited for Ghislain, his face pale as a sheet. “What are you doing? What on earth are you trying to do? Are you trying to get us all killed?” Ghislain said nothing, merely tilting his head. “Why are you making a name for yourself?! Why are you so excited?! Word has spread everywhere!” Of course, the exploits of a mere soldier wouldn’t reach the royal capital or high-ranking nobles. But within the nearby units, the rumors had spread far and wide. Ghislain averted his eyes slightly as he responded. “I was just… bored…” “Bored?! And you get first place for that?!” “…” “Count, please! Can’t you just lie low? I don’t want to die! You’re not even part of the royal army!” “…” Tears welled up in Baron Shear’s eyes as he continued. “Do you know what they’re saying about you? They’re calling you someone who’s imitating Count Fenris! The real Count Fenris!” Perhaps going overboard with his combat drills hadn’t been the best idea. Ghislain nodded slightly and changed the subject. “We’ve taken first place, so I’ll try to be more restrained now. So, why are you here?” Baron Shear glanced around nervously. While he claimed to have come to commend the soldier he’d recommended, his true purpose was different. The reprimands were merely a preamble. Leaning in close, Baron Shear whispered in a hushed tone. “The location and time have been decided.”
