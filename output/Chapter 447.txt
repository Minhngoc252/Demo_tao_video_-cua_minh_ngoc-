If the Delphine Ducal faction and the Salvation Order could be purged from the Kingdom of Rutania, Ghislain and the Northern Army would finally be free to assist other kingdoms without restraint. The envoys understood the rationale. _"So this is why we were summoned."_ _"He’s not wrong. If Rutania falls, the entire continent will be thrown into chaos."_ _"We need Rutania to keep supporting us. To ensure that, they must win their civil war."_ While they wanted to protest, they had already accepted significant aid from Rutania. Any dissent might jeopardize that lifeline. After some deliberation, the Grimwell Kingdom’s envoy reluctantly spoke. “We’ll commit 10,000 troops to assist. In return, we ask that you resolve your civil war as quickly as possible and help us afterward.” Ghislain’s argument was sound; it was imperative to decisively address one crisis before tackling others. With Grimwell’s agreement, the other envoys followed suit. “We’ll also send 10,000 troops.” “Our kingdom can commit 5,000 for now. I’ll confirm with my government and see if additional forces can be arranged.” “We’ll contribute 8,000.” By the end of the negotiations, Ghislain had secured promises for a total of nearly **20,000 troops** , bringing the combined force of the Northern Army and Fenris troops close to **30,000 soldiers**. _"Good, this should suffice,"_ Ghislain thought with satisfaction. Dealing with the Salvation Order’s high priests—practically superhuman adversaries—alongside the Delphine faction, required overwhelming military strength. As the atmosphere lightened with the agreements in place, some of Rutania’s loyalist nobles allowed themselves a moment of celebration. “Troops from other kingdoms! The Delphine faction doesn’t stand a chance now!” Feeling triumphant, General Maurice, head of the Rutania Kingdom’s forces, laughed heartily and clapped Ghislain on the back. “There he is, my nephew!” “...” Ghislain kept silent, unsure of when exactly he had become Maurice’s “nephew.” The envoys, eager to curry favor, offered their congratulations. “Amazing, truly! Marquis Maurice is lucky to have such a talented young man in his family!” “Remarkable. To think he’s a Master already!” “Yes, and his leadership has brought hope to the entire kingdom!” Ghislain maintained a stoic expression, letting the flattery wash over him without comment. The Grimwell envoy then shifted the conversation to a lighter note. “By the way, about the Fenris Mercenary Corps… don’t you think you’ve taken too many mercenaries from us? Even in our kingdom, quite a number have left for Rutania.” “Indeed,” another envoy added. “Our mercenaries have been flocking to your side as well. At this rate, there won’t be any left for us to hire!” Their tone was jovial, but their words carried a sharp edge. The Fenris Mercenary Corps had grown significantly, attracting mercenaries from across the continent due to its unmatched benefits and reputation. It was no longer a minor issue. Ghislain, unfazed, nodded. “So, you’re saying that it’s becoming difficult for your kingdoms because so many mercenaries are joining us?” “That’s correct,” one envoy replied, seizing the opportunity. “This is precisely when mercenaries are needed most! Yet they abandon their homelands to flock to you. Perhaps some sort of regulation is in order…” Ghislain leaned back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips. “Why complicate matters? The solution is simple—just hire from the Fenris Mercenary Corps.” “Hire… what?” Ghislain’s sharp gaze swept over the room. “The easiest way to ensure mercenaries don’t leave your borders is to establish **Fenris Mercenary Corps branches** in your kingdoms.” “Branches…?” “Yes. Register all your mercenaries under the Fenris Corps and let them operate through us. Problem solved.” The room fell silent. The envoys’ expressions shifted to stunned disbelief. _"Does this lunatic intend to monopolize all mercenaries on the continent?"_ Even Rutania’s loyalist nobles, who were familiar with Ghislain’s antics, exchanged knowing glances. _"Here he goes again."_ The Grimwell envoy cleared his throat awkwardly. “Let me clarify… Are you suggesting that all mercenaries across the continent should join the Fenris Corps?” “Well, didn’t you just say it’s a problem when mercenaries leave your kingdoms? This solves that issue.” _"That’s not what we meant!"_ The Grimwell envoy tried to explain more carefully. “We also need mercenaries for various tasks—combat, logistics, disaster recovery… Mercenaries are critical to our national infrastructure.” “Then hire them from us.” _"Why is this man so insistent?"_ The Grimwell envoy’s patience wore thin. “The military support agreement was already settled. Now you’re suggesting we pay extra to hire mercenaries from your private organization?” “Have you ever seen a mercenary fight for free?” “...” The envoys ground their teeth in frustration. They couldn’t argue with the logic, but the sheer audacity of Ghislain’s proposal was maddening. For the seasoned negotiators in the room, Ghislain was proving to be a formidable adversary. _"This man exploits every opportunity."_ _"How did things turn out like this?"_ _"Do we even have a choice?"_ Seeing their hesitation, Ghislain pressed on. “Managing mercenaries effectively during wartime is critical. By centralizing operations under the Fenris Mercenary Corps, we ensure maximum efficiency. Let’s also consider a law restricting mercenary activity during the war to those affiliated with the Fenris Corps.” He grinned. “This will streamline operations and avoid unnecessary conflicts. What do you say?” The envoys were struck silent. Ghislain’s proposal made sense—on paper. Centralized control would indeed make managing the war effort more efficient. But the idea of one person wielding such power over the continent’s mercenaries was unsettling. _"If he succeeds, he’ll effectively rule through this network."_ Even Marquis Branford, used to Ghislain’s unorthodox tactics, shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Do we really need to go that far?” Branford asked, clearing his throat. Ghislain responded confidently. “Mercenaries won’t work for free. And if we allow them to operate independently, they’ll only create chaos. A centralized system is the best solution—for now.” His reasoning was difficult to refute. The war demanded unprecedented coordination, and unifying the mercenaries under one banner seemed logical. Reluctantly, the Grimwell envoy nodded. “Very well. For now, we’ll agree to this arrangement.” One by one, the other envoys followed suit. Ghislain’s grin widened. **The Fenris Mercenary Corps was now poised to dominate the continent.** The issue of mercenary migration to Fenris was resolved decisively. By making all mercenaries part of the **Fenris Mercenary Corps** , and establishing branches in every kingdom, Ghislain ensured that mercenaries could continue working in their home regions under Fenris' umbrella. If any mercenaries wished to leave, Fenris would oversee and manage the transition. The envoys, bound by the chains of dependence on Rutania’s resources and unaccustomed to Ghislain’s unrelenting pressure, had no choice but to agree. With the mercenary issue settled, Ghislain shifted the conversation. “Now that the alliance is established, shouldn’t we elect a leader to oversee its operations?” The Grimwell envoy, clearly caught off guard, stammered a response. “Ah, well, as per our earlier suggestion… If you’re dissatisfied, perhaps we can deliberate further—” “Deliberate? With time running out, when exactly will we have the luxury of endless discussions?” “B-but there are protocols to follow—” “Protocols slow us down. Let’s appoint Marquis Branford as the interim leader and handle it now.” _"This bastard! Can’t he compromise on**anything**?!"_ The Grimwell envoy flushed with frustration but swallowed his anger. The other envoys hesitated, caught between their discomfort and the growing sense of inevitability. Marquis Branford himself watched the proceedings with a hint of amusement, as though he were entertained by Ghislain’s relentless approach. Finally, Ghislain pressed further. “Let’s put out the immediate fires and hold a proper vote later. Isn’t that the most pragmatic course of action?” His directness left no room for argument. One by one, the envoys conceded. “Very well. Since the alliance structure is still rudimentary, we’ll agree for **now** that Marquis Branford will serve as interim leader. Once things are more stable, we’ll revisit the election.” “Let’s proceed with that plan.” With such swiftness, Ghislain bulldozed through layers of protocol and hesitation to finalize critical decisions. The nobles of Rutania were left speechless. Alliance discussions were never handled with such brute force. Normally, negotiations would involve carefully worded proposals, compromises, and mutual appeasement. Ghislain, however, had steamrolled the entire process. Still, the Rutania nobles remained silent, knowing how much they stood to gain. _"This boy is something else. I should treat him to a feast of roast duck."_ _"If we play our cards right, Rutania could become the continent’s leader."_ _"Good thing I listened to my wife and supported him."_ Marquis Branford finally turned to Ghislain and asked with a wry smile, “And what about you? Do you have any intention of leading this alliance yourself?” The room fell silent. The very idea sent a shiver down the spines of the envoys. _"That lunatic can’t possibly be the representative!"_ Thankfully, Ghislain shook his head. “Not yet. For now, your reputation and influence are essential.” Branford chuckled, catching the implication. Ghislain wasn’t even hiding his intention to use him as a stepping stone. The marquis nodded. “Very well. Let me know when the time comes.” “Thank you, Marquis.” The envoys exchanged uneasy glances. Something about the entire situation felt off. Every decision seemed to veer away from their expectations. But they had taken too much—food, medicine, military aid—to protest effectively. _"Damn it, was this his plan all along? To tie us up like this?"_ _"I’ll be scolded when I report back home."_ _"We can’t do anything about it for now. We still need their support to survive."_ The Grimwell envoy, now thoroughly uncomfortable, attempted to change the subject. “Well then, for the finer details, we should convene our staff for further discussions and create a structured plan—” “Aaah, but that will take time, won’t it?” Ghislain interrupted. “Bringing the staff together, drafting a plan, waiting for approvals—it’ll be days before we see any progress.” “Still, we need a proper framework in place—” “Of course! Which is why I’ve already prepared one. Bring them in!” At Ghislain’s command, the door opened, and several figures entered the room. The man at the forefront, exuding an air of confidence and smugness, greeted the envoys with a wide smile. “Greetings! I am Claude, the steward of Fenris. These are Fenris’ administrators. Together, we’ve prepared everything necessary to create a truly _family-like_ alliance.” The envoys were stunned into silence by the unexpected arrival of this eccentric-looking man. "What in the world is going on now?"
