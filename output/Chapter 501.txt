Gatros trembled violently. If someone as skilled as Count Fenris exerted his power, those items would turn to dust in an instant. He couldn't let that happen. He had to reclaim them at all costs. “You... you dare…” His mind was in chaos. He wanted to grab that insolent bastard and tear him apart immediately. _Chiik…_ Ghislain glanced at his arm, black energy crackling around it. Even though he'd blocked Gatros's attack, the man’s energy still lingered. It was no ordinary power; even from a brief glimpse, it was clear to Ghislain that this force was exceptional. ‘That guy’s different. A priest, was it?’ In his past life, he’d never encountered someone like this. It seemed likely that Gatros was the true power leading the Salvation Order from behind the scenes. Unlike other priests of the Order, his techniques weren’t particularly refined, but the sheer force of his energy was beyond what Ghislain could measure. They weren’t ordinary opponents. But Ghislain still smiled nonchalantly, shaking the items in both his hands. “These seem pretty important. Everyone stay still, alright? If anyone moves, I really will destroy them.” He didn’t actually plan to destroy them. He was curious about what made these items so important to them. But Gatros didn’t know that. He had no choice but to believe Ghislain’s words. If the man didn’t understand their significance, he might actually destroy them out of spite. Suppressing his rage, Gatros spoke through gritted teeth. “Hand over those items. I will grant you whatever you desire.” “Hm, must be something very important,” Ghislain teased. “…” “But here’s the thing—I don’t really want anything from you.” “You bastard…” “Oh, wait. Actually, there is one thing.” “What is it?” Gatros’s face twisted, veins bulging as he resembled a vengeful specter. Ghislain smirked. “I want to know what these are. If you tell me, I might think about it. After all, they might be useless to me, right?” _Crack._ Gatros ground his teeth in frustration. The situation was humiliating. He wanted nothing more than to tear Ghislain apart, but with the items he had searched so long for at risk, he had to suppress his fury. But revealing the secrets of the Order was unthinkable. Even if Ghislain didn’t fully comprehend their meaning, he couldn’t allow anything to slip. As Gatros remained silent, Ghislain swung the items slightly, his grin widening. “What’s taking so long? Not talking? Fine, I’ll really destroy them.” Gatros bit his lip hard enough to draw blood. Why should he have to reveal the Order’s secrets to someone like this? His hands trembled, energy surging uncontrollably. Yet he couldn’t bring himself to attack Ghislain. The rumors he had heard were enough. This man was a lunatic. Even if he revealed the truth, it was doubtful the items would be returned. He couldn’t fall for it. Others in the room seemed to share Gatros’s hesitation. Kaien spoke coldly, addressing Gatros. “That man will never return those items.” “Count Balzac,” Gatros hissed. “You said the relics weren’t the only ones, correct? Aren’t others being sought in different kingdoms?” “What are you implying?” Kaien pointed his sword at Ghislain and declared, “Killing him is just as important. Let us take this chance to kill him, and we’ll find the relics elsewhere.” “…” Gatros shot a sharp glare at Kaien. Kaien wasn’t a priest of the Salvation Order, but he understood how much the Duke of Delphine desired the relics. If even Kaien suggested this course, it was likely the right one. “... So be it. This, too, must be the will of God.” Gatros exhaled deeply, closing his eyes. As a priest, he had shown an embarrassingly pitiful side of himself. But he was so close to finally achieving a long-sought goal, only for it to be snatched away. Watching Gatros regain his composure, Ghislain clicked his tongue. ‘Tch. This guy’s no ordinary fool.’ Not only was his strength formidable, but his patience and ability to suppress his desires were also remarkable, even with something so important at stake. While he hadn’t learned the full truth about the items, Ghislain had gleaned something valuable. ‘So, there are more of these in other kingdoms?’ Though it seemed they hadn’t found them yet, it was clear these items weren’t unique. He could adjust his plans accordingly. Ghislain turned his gaze toward Berhem, who was watching with wide eyes. “Hey.” “What did you just say?” Berhem’s expression was incredulous. How dare this man address him, the king of this realm, in such a manner! “You insolent wretch! You truly live up to the rumors of being a wild brute from the frontier! How dare a noble of this kingdom speak so brazenly to his king!” Ghislain didn’t bother hiding his irritation. “Cut the crap. Can I destroy this or not?” “No, you cannot!” Berhem reached out desperately, shouting. That item was essential for maintaining his body. He could already feel it slowly breaking apart. “What do you want? Name your price, and I will grant it. Land? Titles? Whatever you wish, just return that to me.” At Berhem’s pleading tone, Ghislain tilted his head. “I told you, I’m curious about what this is.” “That is the Life Orb, necessary to sustain my body! It will elevate me to a transcendent being!” Berhem’s desperation was clear. Ghislain nodded slightly. Just as he thought. This was the secret behind how the Salvation Order created their high priests. ‘I’ll need to study this further when I get back.’ But he couldn’t figure out the necklace’s purpose. Judging from the reactions, no one was going to spill that information. Kaien’s voice cut through the tense air as he addressed Berhem. “Your Majesty, I will kill him. Command the Royal Guard and Kingdom’s army.” “What… what did you say? Then how am I supposed to create my Core?” Kaien responded coldly, his expression unwavering. “You can create it again. With your support, it won’t take long.” “That means…” Berhem swallowed hard. Kaien’s words meant they would need more sacrifices—thousands of lives to recreate what had been lost. The Salvation Order had long followed this gruesome method to forge their high priests. Kaien turned his gaze back to Ghislain, his eyes sharp. “He won’t return it. That’s just the kind of man he is.” Ghislain scoffed, leaning lazily to one side. “Why do you all see me that way?” It was annoyingly accurate, which made it worse. Kaien’s sword gleamed as he pointed it forward, energy surging around him. “This is the perfect chance to kill that troublesome man. We no longer need to be led around by him.” “But…” Berhem hesitated. Even as king, the thought of taking so many lives to rebuild the Core weighed on him. It wasn’t out of any moral concern for the lives he’d take—he simply hated the idea of waiting for such a long process to start over. But Kaien had already made his decision. Unless the Duke of Delphine countermanded him, not even the king could stop him. “All forces…” Kaien’s low voice rippled across the plains, reaching every soldier in the Delphine army. _Clang!_ _Clang!_ _Clang!_ The soldiers drew their weapons, preparing for battle. “Assassinate Count Fenris!” _BOOM!_ With Kaien’s command, he surged toward Ghislain, his blade ready to strike. Gatros followed closely behind him, his aura blazing, and the entire Delphine army charged in unison. “Well, this is a mess,” Ghislain said with a smirk, infusing his legs with mana. No matter how strong he was, taking them all on alone was impossible. It was time to initiate the next phase of his plan. _BOOM!_ The ground shattered beneath him as Ghislain propelled himself backward, his body sliding across the battlefield. In an instant, he pivoted and bolted away. Watching Ghislain retreat, Berhem clenched his teeth and shouted, “Kill him! Do whatever it takes to kill him!” This man had ruined negotiations and insulted him personally. He had to be captured and torn limb from limb. Count Phalantz surged forward, leading the royal troops in pursuit. The commander of the 3rd Infantry Company, running frantically among them, felt tears of frustration welling up. ‘What the hell is this? Why is this happening to me?’ He had thought the man was just some talented soldier. There had been rumors that someone was imitating Count Fenris, but he hadn’t taken them seriously. Who could have guessed that it was the real Count Fenris? It felt like finding a lucky charm, only for it to turn into a cursed doll in an instant. The other soldiers felt much the same, especially those from the Dougly Squad. Their shock was even greater. “Is this for real? Was that really Count Fenris?” “He wasn’t just a copycat?” “Shit! We’re all dead!” Tears streaming, they ran on. It was unlikely that this would end well for any of them. At that moment, the voice of Ghislain echoed in the 3rd Infantry Company commander’s ears. — “If you want to live, pretend to chase me and lead your soldiers to the location I’ll tell you. The knights of Fenris will guide you. Or don’t, and stay here. If you’re unlucky, you’ll die. Your choice.” The commander snapped to attention. Ghislain was right. The king, infamous for his madness, wouldn’t spare them. There was a high chance the 3rd Infantry Company would be slaughtered to the last man. Hearing Ghislain’s instructions, the commander wiped his tears and shouted, “3rd Infantry Company, follow me!” He began to shift directions subtly as he chased Ghislain, and his bewildered soldiers followed. The 3rd Infantry Company had only ever trained for one thing—charging. If nothing else, they were confident in their ability to run. The Delphine forces and the royal army paid no attention to them. Everyone was focused solely on Ghislain. “Stop right there!” Gatros roared, unleashing a surge of overwhelming energy. He moved so quickly that even Kaien, renowned as the kingdom’s greatest swordsman, was left trailing. Blinded by rage, Gatros hurled another burst of energy toward Ghislain’s back. _BOOM! BOOM!_ Explosions erupted across the battlefield as black pillars of energy tore through the ground. “Yikes.” Ghislain barely dodged the attacks, weaving around the destruction. The repeated shifts in direction, however, began to slow him down. Seizing the opportunity, Kaien closed the gap and slashed his sword with lightning speed. _Kaga-ga-ga-gak!_ The blade collided with the mana surrounding Ghislain, producing a grinding, metallic screech. “Oh?” Kaien slashed his sword with a furrowed brow. He was certain he had struck Ghislain in the chest, but in the blink of an eye, Ghislain was already far away. As Kaien resumed his chase, a thought struck him. ‘There’s… no blood?’ There were visible cuts on Ghislain’s clothing, and even if the wounds were shallow, such intense movement should have caused at least a few drops of blood to spill. But Ghislain, running as swiftly as light, didn’t leave even a single drop of blood behind. ‘What kind of ability is this?’ Perhaps he had sealed the wounds with mana. Kaien himself could do that, but not at such an extraordinary speed. Unaware of Ghislain’s regenerative capabilities, Kaien couldn’t make sense of the situation. _BOOOOM!_ Magic rained down amidst the Delphine forces and the royal army as they pursued Ghislain. The intent wasn’t to land a direct hit but to slow him down in any way possible. Even the priests of the Salvation Order unleashed their full energy at him without hesitation. _BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOOOM!_ The deafening explosions resounded as if the heavens and earth were collapsing, tearing through the surroundings. Yet, even with such widespread, large-scale magic, they couldn’t catch Ghislain. By the time the spells detonated, he had already moved out of the area. “Keep chasing him!” Kaien roared, determined to close the distance. Gatros was equally relentless. They believed it was only a matter of time. No matter how strong Ghislain was, avoiding continuous attacks from multiple assailants would eventually drain his strength. As long as they kept pursuing him, he would tire, and they could capture him. But there was something they hadn’t considered. ‘Tch… they can’t keep up.’ Kaien glanced back over his shoulder. Only the most elite knights and transcendents from the Salvation Order were managing to follow him closely. Beyond them, the cavalry struggled to keep pace. The speed of transcendents, who could run faster than horses, naturally left unmounted soldiers falling further behind. Count Phalantz and the royal forces, who had started late, were even more distant. ‘It doesn’t matter.’ With an army of 100,000 mobilized, even a few hundred chasing him would suffice. This was enough. Whether Ghislain ran or fought back, he would exhaust himself and fall. Ghislain, too, was thinking along similar lines. ‘As expected, Kaien is formidable.’ Ghislain glanced down at his tattered, sliced clothing and chuckled. There was a reason Kaien was called the kingdom’s strongest swordsman. If Kaien had fully reached his potential in Ghislain’s previous life, he might have been one of the continent’s Eight Strongest instead of just the Seven. ‘I’d like to face him properly someday…’ But now wasn’t the time. The others wouldn’t allow a one-on-one duel. ‘Just a bit further.’ He had to make it out of the plains. His allies were waiting to assist him. It wasn’t a short distance—he would have to keep running for quite a while. Mana was steadily being drained. _BOOOOM!_ Ghislain cloaked himself in black energy, accelerating even faster. The technique consumed an enormous amount of mana and couldn’t be sustained for long, but right now, escaping was his top priority. “That bastard…” Kaien clenched his teeth, frustrated at Ghislain’s staggering speed. _BOOOOM!_ Kaien was forced to push his body to its limits, drawing even more mana to keep up. He didn’t necessarily need to overtake Ghislain—just wearing him down would be enough. After all, they had others on their side who could wield similarly unnatural powers. _BOOOOM!_ “I’ll catch you and kill you!” Dark energy erupted from Gatros, forming into massive wings on his back. The priests of the Salvation Order followed suit, surging forward with heightened speed. Although they couldn’t fully close the gap, they had narrowed the distance enough for their ranged attacks to reach. Black pillars of energy erupted violently around Ghislain. And that wasn’t all. The dark energy launched by Gatros and the priests shot directly toward him with pinpoint accuracy. _BOOM! BOOM! BOOOOM!_ Ghislain’s body zigzagged as he deflected the relentless attacks. Forced to block the precise strikes of dark energy, he was gradually being pushed closer to Kaien. Kaien, now within range, infused his sword with mana, preparing for a decisive strike. If the priests attacked just a few more times, he would be able to land a blow on Ghislain. The air buzzed with tension. Ghislain clicked his tongue internally and pushed his body harder. He just needed to reach the area where his first reinforcements were stationed. _BOOM! BOOM! BOOOOM!_ Despite his increased efforts, deflecting and dodging the black energy attacks slowed him down, allowing his pursuers to close in. Then, in the distance, a figure emerged, rushing toward him. “My lord!” It was Piote. Piote charged forward, radiating holy energy. He had clearly been training diligently, as his speed was impressive. Strangely, multiple belts were strapped across Piote’s body, designed for someone to grab onto. _BOOM! BOOM! BOOOOM!_ The priests’ attacks showed no signs of stopping, but Piote didn’t flinch as he ran straight for Ghislain. Ghislain continued dodging and deflecting attacks as he headed toward Piote. “Piote!” Ghislain shouted, and Piote immediately turned around. Ghislain grabbed onto the belts on Piote’s back, hoisting him up like a shield as he spun around. At that moment, Kaien was right in front of him. ‘Madman.’ From Kaien’s perspective, Ghislain’s actions were utterly disgraceful. To use another person as a shield just to save himself? And a knight using a woman(?) as a shield, no less. ‘It doesn’t matter.’ He would simply cut through them both. Kaien clenched his teeth and swung his sword with all his might. _SLAAAASH!_ The sound of the air being torn apart echoed as the blade descended. Ghislain, now fully within range, wouldn’t be able to dodge. It was too late. The unidentified woman(?) would be sliced in half instantly, and Count Fenris would either be grievously injured or forced to expend a massive amount of mana. Kaien was confident in his strike. But then— _THUMP!_ “What?” Kaien’s sword, which should have struck with devastating power, felt as though it had hit a thick cushion of wool. And the supposed shield, the woman(?), was completely unharmed. Even after being struck by an aura blade capable of cutting through dragon scales, she(?) remained unscathed. Kaien couldn’t comprehend what was happening.
