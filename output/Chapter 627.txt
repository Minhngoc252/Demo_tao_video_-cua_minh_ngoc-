“What... what is this...?” Arterion, who had been attacking with maddened fervor just moments before, now seemed completely lost. The form Ghislain displayed was identical to the adversary Arterion once knew. There could not be two adversaries. And yet, how could two people simultaneously exhibit the appearance of the adversary? “You wretch! What kind of sorcery is this?!” Arterion roared, but he was so overwhelmed by confusion that he failed to notice Ghislain swiftly closing the distance between them. In an instant, Ghislain struck a devastating blow to Arterion’s body. SLASH! “GRAAAAH!” A deep gash tore through Arterion’s chest, deeper than any wound he had suffered so far. Ghislain immediately ceased his amplification and retreated. Having grown accustomed to the power of the fifth-tier core, he could now sustain it longer thanks to his enhanced regenerative capabilities. However, amplification through Dark was still beyond his limits. Prolonging its use would lead to his collapse. CREAK! Even after a single use, his legs were beginning to tremble. The only reason he could still stand was because his mana reserves were already heavily depleted before the amplification began. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Ghislain’s attack signaled the others to charge in unison, launching another wave of strikes. Arterion staggered under the barrage of attacks, sustaining more and more wounds. He thrashed his massive body in retaliation, but the precision of his movements was long gone. Fatigue weighed him down, but what truly hindered him was the chaos clouding his mind. ‘Why? Why are there two adversaries?’ The power Ghislain briefly displayed was undoubtedly that of the adversary. His appearance was eerily similar as well. Such dark energy could only be wielded by those aligned with the Salvation Order. ‘Have I been deceived?’ Ereneth had undoubtedly encountered this man. If so, she would have noticed such an aura. It would have been impossible to miss during battle. But had she simply let it slide? That made no sense. ‘No, there must be a reason. Ereneth wouldn’t overlook something like this without cause.’ For a fleeting moment, Arterion questioned whether Ereneth had betrayed him. However, he quickly dismissed the thought. No one despised the Salvation Order more than Ereneth, and she would never align herself with them. Even as Arterion was pushed back, his focus remained on Ghislain’s amplified energy. ‘It’s different.’ The appearance was strikingly similar, yet the energy was subtly distinct. Like Ereneth, Arterion sensed no malice within it—only an ominous, inexplicable presence. Still, he couldn’t comprehend it. Such energy wasn’t something one could obtain through ordinary means. Though it differed from the adversary’s aura, the dark energy was undeniable. ‘Its essence... it shares the same origin as the Salvation Order. It carries the Demon God’s energy.’ Ereneth would have recognized this as well. If she chose to overlook it, she must have had her reasons, though they were beyond Arterion’s understanding. In truth, Arterion’s confusion stemmed from his ignorance of Dark’s existence. Even Ereneth had only suspected it, believing Dark to be a different type of spirit. As an elf highly attuned to spiritual energy, she lacked the certainty to draw conclusions. Ereneth’s sensitivity to the Demon God’s energy, while formidable, could not rival that of a dragon. Arterion recalled Ereneth’s earlier hypothesis. ‘Could it be... he acquired that?’ That entity had been sealed alongside the adversary. If the adversary had reappeared, then it was possible the entity had as well. And now, here stood the adversary. Ghislain’s bursts of amplified energy were fleeting, making it difficult for Arterion to analyze them fully. Yet the brief glimpses he caught lingered in his mind. ‘It feels as though...’ It was as if the adversary had been split in two. If so, who was the true adversary? Even if a mere human had obtained the entity, they shouldn’t be able to wield such dark energy so effortlessly. Only the adversary could fully harness its power. Arterion could not determine who the real adversary was. Until now, he had focused all his attacks on Julien. But... ‘What if this Ghislain is the adversary?’ It was a notion that defied reason, but he couldn’t completely dismiss it. The problem was that Arterion was utterly exhausted. The humans had prepared meticulously to fight him. If only he could use magic freely, he wouldn’t have been cornered like this. ‘I can’t be certain, so I must kill them both. But... it’s impossible right now.’ RAAAAAAAHHH! Arterion let out a furious roar, refusing to accept the situation. How could he, the mightiest of dragons, be forced into such a corner? Yet, he wasn’t so foolish as to deny reality. If this continued, he would surely lose his life. ‘I must retreat.’ He could not afford to die here. He had to kill the adversary. For now, retreating was the only option. Though his strength was nearly depleted, he could still escape if he poured all his remaining energy into it. He had identified the adversary—or at least, he believed he had. Whether it was one or the other, killing both would suffice. Though his pride was deeply wounded, there were more important matters at stake. ‘You will never have another chance like this!’ He could swallow his pride and fight cunningly. One by one, he would hunt down and destroy the humans’ strongholds. From now on, they would live in terror, never knowing when he might strike. “Grrrr... just you wait.” FLAP! Arterion spread his wings wide. It was time to flee. If he could get far enough away, they wouldn’t be able to catch him. But then, Arterion’s mind was suddenly engulfed by a black fog. And a voice echoed through his consciousness. “...Find me.” THUD! The words sent a violent shock through his mind. “Graaahhh!” Something—or someone—was invading his thoughts. Arterion realized that something was profoundly wrong. But it was too late. His mind was consumed entirely by the black fog. ROAR! Arterion lifted his head high and roared toward the heavens. His eyes were once again filled with battle lust and murderous intent. How could he, the strongest of all beings, flee from mere human insects? “Grrr... I will kill them all...” Such humiliation was unacceptable. Arterion knew he had to kill the adversary and the remaining humans here and now. With his eyes blazing with fury, Arterion launched a ferocious attack once again. “I will kill the adversary!” Arterion’s mind was consumed with murderous intent. Somehow, he had to kill the adversary. He had underestimated the humans’ meticulous preparations. His life would likely end here. But he was determined to take at least one of them down with him. Ereneth would handle the rest. She was an elf of unparalleled caution and cunning. The most elven yet least elven of her kind. She would deal with the remaining adversary. ROAAAR! Arterion, abandoning all care for his own life, recklessly launched himself into a relentless assault. This left him vulnerable. His body was now drenched in blood. The dragon’s indomitable spirit and physique were beginning to crumble. The superhumans, sensing the end, swarmed him with renewed determination. Instinctively, they knew they had to finish this now. “There won’t be a second chance.” “He was about to flee.” “If we let him escape, we’re all dead.” If Arterion escaped, the continent would be doomed. If they fought him again, even the strategies they had used today wouldn’t work. Victory would be impossible. Arterion’s pride as a dragon seemed to have overridden his initial decision to retreat. That arrogance made it clear—they had to kill him now, no matter the cost. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Everyone fought with every ounce of strength they had. Bones broke, flesh was torn, but they placed their trust in the divine power to keep them alive. Even with their mana drained, they swung their weapons with blind determination. Arterion’s body, now shredded like a rag, couldn’t even unfurl its wings properly anymore. ROAAAR! Arterion, too, gave everything he had left. With his depleted mana, he attempted low-circle spells repeatedly. The mages remaining at the fortress dispelled them, their noses bleeding from the strain. Both sides knew it now: the battle was reaching its end. THUD! Arterion’s colossal body wavered and collapsed to one side. Still, he flailed his tail and claws wildly in the air. The superhumans attacking him could barely stand either. Their arms and legs trembled uncontrollably. Kaor had already collapsed, wheezing for breath. Even the divine power’s restorative effects had limits. The priests’ reserves of divine energy were nearly exhausted, and the recipients, their mana completely drained, were suffering from the backlash, their bodies deteriorating. Even Parniel, known for her immense stamina, momentarily lost grip of her mace. “Phew!” The only ones still standing, albeit unsteadily, were Ghislain and Julien. It wasn’t because they were physically stronger than Parniel. Parniel had absorbed the brunt of the attacks due to her aggressive tactics, leading to far greater exhaustion. But thanks to her sacrifices, they had been able to push Arterion to the brink more quickly. Ghislain realized it was time to end it for good. The final move had to be made. ROAAR! THUD! Arterion struck the ground with his tail once more but couldn’t continue the attack, leaving an opening. Ghislain gripped his sword tightly and spoke. “Julien.” “...Yeah.” BOOM! The two mustered the last of their strength and charged at Arterion. FOOSH! Ghislain’s body was once again cloaked in black mist. He had been using it sparingly during his attacks, but this would be the last time. He had no energy left to sustain it further. He drew upon the force of his will once more, bending the flow of the world to ensure his strike would succeed. VROOM! Time seemed to slow. The space around them fell under Ghislain’s domain. Arterion, struggling to lift his claw, recognized the manipulation of the space but couldn’t react as he had before. As Ghislain thrust his sword toward Arterion’s dragon heart with all his might— ‘Huh?’ A faint ripple brushed against Ghislain’s senses. Amid the flow of the world, something unidentified was moving, slithering quietly. ‘What is that?’ It was an unfamiliar energy. Though he couldn’t see it, he could feel its presence. This space was a realm shared by Ghislain and the flow of the world. Any entity that moved against that flow couldn’t escape his notice. The energy was seeping endlessly from Arterion’s wounds. SLASH! Ghislain’s sword pierced Arterion’s dragon heart. But his mind was elsewhere. ‘It’s moving.’ The energy slithered like a snake. It was not a normal energy. If it had been, he wouldn’t have missed it before. Ghislain turned his head slowly, following the energy’s direction. ‘...Julien?’ It was heading toward Julien. Ghislain tried to call out to Julien, to warn him of the approaching presence. But he froze when he saw Julien’s expression. Julien’s gaze was also fixed on the energy. He watched silently as it invaded his body. ‘Julien, you...’ Julien slowly turned his head. His eyes were not on the dying Arterion but elsewhere entirely. In that fractured moment of time— Their gazes met in the void.
