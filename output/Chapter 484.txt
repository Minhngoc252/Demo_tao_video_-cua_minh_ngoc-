"Where did you hear that name?" The existence of the _Shadow Knights_ was known to only a very small number of people within the kingdom. It was a name that someone like Ghislain Ferdium, who had grown up in the remote North and was not part of the central nobility, should have never known. Marquis Branford furrowed his brow. He had long suspected that Ghislain Ferdium possessed an uncanny level of knowledge. Sometimes, it felt less like intelligence and more like prophecy. But even so, knowing such secret royal information was beyond comprehension. "Did you plant a spy within the royal family?" It seemed the only plausible explanation. Ghislain was certainly capable of such a thing if it served his purposes. Sensing the sudden tension, Ghislain decided to clear up the misunderstanding. He had a convenient excuse for situations like this. "I heard it from a priest of the Salvation Order," he said confidently. "…?" "They said they fought the _Shadow Knights_ a long time ago. Apparently, they even attacked the royal family." "What… what are you talking about…?" "I’m asking because I think this war is connected to those events." Blaming others proved to be surprisingly effective. And it wasn’t entirely a lie, either. As Ghislain spoke without hesitation, Marquis Branford held back his suspicions and swallowed his words. "Hmm…" It was hard to question someone who claimed they had learned it from the enemy. Although Ghislain’s explanation was still suspicious, there was no way to verify it. After a moment of deliberation, Marquis Branford sighed and spoke. "I don’t know much either. Only that they supposedly protected the royal family from the shadows." This time, it was Ghislain’s turn to frown. How could the kingdom’s most influential noble, with access to almost all information, not know about them? Seeing Ghislain’s blatant skepticism, Marquis Branford let out a wry chuckle and continued. "It’s an organization that no longer exists. All that remains are records of its existence. No matter how much you dig, you won’t find anything." "Does the Chancellor know anything about them?" "No, he doesn’t. The _Shadow Knights_ were an extremely secretive group. I asked him once myself, but he said the most he ever did was supply them with resources when they requested it." "So no one truly knows anything about them?" "Exactly. That’s what makes them a secret organization. Even Maurice, the Kingdom Army’s Supreme Commander, doesn’t know they ever existed." "Then… is there any information on why they disbanded?" "Only that it was due to internal discord." Ghislain gazed directly into Marquis Branford’s eyes and said, "It’s hard to believe such a secretive group existed within the royal family." "I didn’t believe it at first either. But from what you’re saying, it seems they were fighting the Salvation Order long before now. Their disbandment might not have been due to internal discord after all." "Yes, the _Shadow Knights_ and the Salvation Order clashed once before." "Hmm. Do you know why the Salvation Order is targeting the royal family?" "I don’t know that either." Marquis Branford deliberated for a moment before speaking again. "It seems the Ducal Faction isn’t rebelling simply for power." "That appears to be the case. They’ve been operating from the shadows for a long time. All I know is that their plans failed once because of the _Shadow Knights_." "Perhaps His Majesty might know something. He was directly managing state affairs during the time the _Shadow Knights_ were active." Hearing this, Ghislain’s eyes lit up. "Now that you mention it, I would like to meet His Majesty." "For what reason?" "I’d like to ask him about the _Shadow Knights_ and find out what happened in the past." However, Marquis Branford shook his head firmly. "No." "Why not?" "His Majesty’s health is extremely poor. Furthermore, he dislikes discussing the _Shadow Knights_." "He dislikes it?" "Yes. That’s why no new organization was formed after their disbandment. Instead, the Royal Knights were strengthened." Thanks to this, the commander of the Royal Knights had been provided with resources such as fragments of the Dragon Heart, allowing him to reach the level of a Master. This also meant that there were no secret organizations left in the Ruthania Royal Family. "Why does His Majesty dislike the _Shadow Knights_?" "They were an organization that followed no one’s orders." "I see." Ghislain nodded as though he understood. No king would tolerate an uncontrollable power within their domain. Still, Ghislain wasn’t one to give up easily. "Can’t I meet him even briefly? Honestly, not to boast, but… it’s me we’re talking about." At this, Marquis Branford couldn’t help but laugh softly. Ghislain was, after all, the kingdom’s savior. Even the king would have a hard time refusing his request. Given Ghislain’s contributions, it would be appropriate for the king to meet him personally. Despite this, Marquis Branford declined again. "Not now. His Majesty is in truly poor health. I’ll check his condition and let you know." "Fine," Ghislain replied, feigning resignation. _"Well, I can just wear a mask and sneak in later."_ Ghislain thought to himself. He wasn’t going there to harm anyone, just to ask a few questions. What could they possibly do about that? Although there was a high chance he’d be caught, he figured he could always brute-force his way through. After all, he only needed a brief conversation. Suddenly, Marquis Branford gave him a sharp glare and warned, "You’re not thinking of sneaking in, are you?" "…Of course not." "No, you’re exactly the type to do that. You’d put on a mask and sneak in if it suited you." "…." Ghislain realized he’d spent far too much time with Marquis Branford, who now understood him all too well. In a resigned tone, Branford added, "Don’t do it. If you suddenly appear or cause a commotion, His Majesty might have a heart attack and pass away." "…Is it that serious?" "Yes, so don’t act rashly. I don’t want you to go down in history as a regicide." "…." The atmosphere grew awkward. Deciding there was nothing more to say on the matter, Marquis Branford changed the subject. "By the way, weren’t you planning to march south immediately?" That had been the original plan: to lure the remaining armies to the southern front and destroy them. "I decided against it because I didn’t think the bait would work. Instead, I opted for a divide-and-conquer strategy, which fortunately succeeded." "Then when do you plan to march south? Wouldn’t it be better to strike as soon as possible?" Marquis Branford shared Maurice’s perspective; now seemed like the ideal opportunity. However, Ghislain had no intention of rushing. "First, we’ll properly reorganize our forces before advancing. The Ducal Faction isn’t an easy opponent. But I won’t delay for too long." "Alright. With this momentum, we should be fine. I’ll leave the war to you." Ghislain nodded. He, too, believed things were progressing well, but he remained cautious. The enemy’s forces were formidable. Among them were the kingdom’s greatest swordsman and mage, as well as Aiden, one of the Continent’s Seven Strongest. Not to mention, the high-ranking priests of the Salvation Order and their leader had yet to reveal their full strength. For now, rest and preparation were crucial. After discussing a few more strategic matters with Marquis Branford, Ghislain rose to leave. Before departing, he asked one last question, "Have you ever met the leader of the _Shadow Knights_?" "…No. I only know of them through records." "I see. Thank you." Ghislain bowed and left. Now wasn’t the time to reveal that the leader of the _Shadow Knights_ had been his mother. Too many uncertainties remained. Watching Ghislain leave, Marquis Branford sank into deep thought. _"To think I would hear that name again…"_ In truth, Marquis Branford had once met the leader of the _Shadow Knights_. He also knew more than he had let on to Ghislain. But he had no intention of sharing the full truth. In his younger years, Marquis Branford had attended a secret meeting at the Chancellor’s request. In that private gathering, a woman with an enigmatic presence stood before him. She wore a simple outfit and a mask that covered most of her face. Even the Chancellor treated her with utmost respect, bowing deeply. “This is my son-in-law,” the Chancellor said, gesturing toward Marquis Branford. “He will assist His Majesty in leading the nation in the future.” The masked woman chuckled softly, her tone tinged with amusement. “Oh? So the next heir you’ve chosen is your son-in-law? Isn’t that a bit too convenient, keeping everything in the family?” “Ahem, that’s not the case. He is more than qualified. He has the ability to protect the kingdom.” “Well, he does seem stubborn. People like that tend to do their jobs well,” the woman said lightly. Her voice, youthful and teasing, felt incongruous with the gravity of the situation. It only deepened Branford’s curiosity. Who was she? Even as he probed discreetly, the Chancellor refused to provide any real answers. He merely repeated that she was someone of great importance to the royal family. That meeting was when Marquis Branford first realized the truth: The kingdom’s real power was not in its public institutions but in the hands of this mysterious woman. Her chosen individuals became the kingdom’s most powerful figures. That was also when Branford learned of the shadow family that protected the kingdom from the darkness. “Do your best. I’ll help you out,” she had said before disappearing into the night. Afterward, the Chancellor had sternly warned Branford, “Never speak of this. This meeting was only to introduce you to her and for her to recognize you as part of her plans. Remember, you must keep this a secret.” At the time, Branford had been young and ambitious. He had no choice but to comply. But soon after, astonishing things began happening in his life. Every challenge he faced seemed to resolve itself effortlessly. His career soared, and his influence grew exponentially. While his capabilities and family connections played a part, the sheer ease with which he succeeded felt almost unnatural. It was as though the world itself conspired to clear his path. While this brought him joy, it also filled him with unease. _“The true force driving this kingdom…”_ Branford’s youthful idealism had made it impossible for him to accept such hidden manipulation. Several times, he had tried to confront the Chancellor, demanding answers. But the Chancellor had always deflected his questions with palpable fear. “We are responsible for the kingdom’s daylight. The night does not belong to us. Do not forget that.” “How can you say that? Why has the royal family tolerated this?” “They do not just protect the kingdom—they monitor it as well.” “They monitor us?” “Yes. Don’t try to understand further. Even I don’t know the full details. Just accept that this is how the kingdom operates.” Frustrated but powerless, Marquis Branford had begrudgingly abandoned his pursuit of the truth. He had resolved to oppose such a system once he gained enough power. Transparency, he believed, was essential for a functioning kingdom. But fate had other plans. One stormy night, years later, Marquis Branford woke to find a bloodied figure standing before him. “You… who are you…?” he stammered. “Shh.” It was her—the leader of the _Shadow Knights_. But something was different this time. Her body was battered, her clothing torn and soaked in blood. Part of her mask was broken, revealing one of her eyes. For the first time, Branford saw a glimpse of her face. “I’m leaving now,” she said. “What… what do you mean?” “The _Shadow Knights_ have been disbanded. Just as you wished.” “Wait, what? I don’t understand…” “Don’t concern yourself with it. The obstacles in your path have been removed. Securing power should be no problem now.” “….” The woman smirked faintly. “Well, you have the ability and family influence to succeed on your own. But removing a few variables doesn’t hurt, does it?” “What are you talking about?” “There was a minor issue. But now you must protect the royal family.” Branford struggled to process her words. The invincible _Shadow Knights_ were gone? Who could have dismantled such a group? “Who… who did this to you?” “The darkness,” she replied, her eyes gleaming ominously. A chill ran down Branford’s spine, but he forced himself to ask, “What is this ‘darkness’?” “You don’t need to know yet. I’ve killed every piece of darkness that showed itself. One day, you’ll understand.” “Then… what should I do now?” “Keep the Ducal Faction in check.” “The Ducal Faction? Why them?” “Yes. They’re the only ones I couldn’t directly interfere with. They’ve stayed quiet for so long out of fear of me.” Branford was stunned. The Ducal Faction had always been enigmatic, avoiding the spotlight despite their immense power. He had often wondered why they refrained from pursuing authority. Now he knew—it was because of her. How powerful must she have been to keep even the Dukes in line? Her voice turned cold as she continued, “When they’re certain I’m gone, the Dukes will reveal their ambitions. The shadow war is over, and the conflict will spill into the light.” “When will that happen?” “They’ll stay quiet for ten years while searching for me. The next ten years, they’ll move cautiously to seize the kingdom. Beyond that, I can’t predict.” “….” “Use that time to solidify your power. Ensure no one can threaten you. I’ve cleared your path for that reason.” “The Duke’s heir, Ernheart, is my friend. He would never do such a thing.” “…I hope you’re right.” She seemed to know Ernheart well, understanding his disinterest in power and his languid nature. But she also knew that circumstances could change. Darkness wouldn’t leave Ernheart untouched. Her body began to dissolve into the shadows. “Don’t forget my words. The royal family’s survival depends on you now.” “Where will you go?” “Anywhere… as long as it’s not the royal palace.” With those parting words, she vanished into the night. Branford stood frozen in place for a long time. By morning, the world seemed unchanged. No news, no rumors—everything was as it had been. At times, he wondered if it had all been a dream. Until he learned of the sudden disappearances and deaths of several nobles. Even now, as he watched Ghislain leave, memories of that night flooded back. _“To think I would hear that name again…”_ He called out sharply, “Steward!” “Yes, Marquis!” The steward hurried over, startled by Branford’s urgency. “Fetch me a portrait of Marchioness Ferdium. Immediately.” “The Marchioness’s portrait, sir?” “Yes, as quickly as possible.” Branford swallowed hard. The icy, piercing gaze he remembered so vividly from that night… …was identical to Ghislain’s.
