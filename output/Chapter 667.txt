"This is my hometown. Since I’ve worked with the merchant guild for a long time, most of the people here know me. And I know many of them as well," Leo began. He had traveled extensively across the territory as a leader of the guild, especially handling essential goods. It was impossible for the people not to recognize him. "I know very well how they live. Most of them are struggling in poverty." Baron Magvel had been a greedy lord, imposing exorbitant taxes and finding every possible way to squeeze more from the people. Naturally, life under such a lord had been harsh. The people had been crushed under the weight of excessive taxation and relentless exploitation. When Leo spoke, his words quickly turned into actions, and policies were implemented. Almost overnight, the lives of the common folk began to change for the better. Observing these changes, Julien and Deneb started to grasp the truth behind Ghislain’s teachings. "To think so many lives could change this drastically…" "This really is the power to change the world." Baron Magvel had imposed misery, while the benevolence of Leo now took his place. With just this change, the territory was transforming, and the lives of its people were improving rapidly. While Julien and Deneb assisted with various tasks as best as they could, it was Leo’s new policies and reforms that reshaped the territory. Watching the joyful expressions of the people, Julien couldn’t help but mutter quietly. "If only the magic beasts didn’t exist…" And if people like Leo were the ones wielding power and governing. Surely, they could change the world. Their role, Julien and Deneb realized, was to support good-hearted individuals who made a difference. This was what they could do best. As the two honed their skills and solidified their resolve, Ghislain remained in the territory, ensuring Leo could secure his newfound power. Once stability was achieved, Ghislain approached Leo with a sly grin. "Well, I guess it’s time for us to settle our deal." The initial agreement of providing 30% of the gold mine’s profits to the mercenary group was now being formalized. With the Raks family now controlling the territory, this arrangement meant that 30% of the territory’s income, including gold mine profits, would go directly to the Julien Mercenary Corps. Leo swallowed nervously and asked, "Did you plan this from the start?" "Of course. A territory with a gold mine? Who wouldn’t aim for that?" Leo chuckled bitterly, looking at Ghislain. The man truly was remarkable. To orchestrate such a bold plan and execute it so flawlessly—it was almost unbelievable. Had Leo known the full details from the start, he likely wouldn’t have believed it, let alone agreed to it. Even now, it felt surreal at times. But a deal was a deal. Having benefited from Ghislain’s intervention, Leo didn’t feel any resentment. After all, without Ghislain, he wouldn’t have had a territory to call his own. "Fine. I’ll honor our agreement. From now on, 30% of the annual revenue will go to the Julien Mercenary Corps." Leo’s firm words brought a smirk to Ghislain’s face, while the other members of the mercenary group looked utterly astonished. "Woah… so we’re rich now?" "I can’t believe it. We’ve just hit the jackpot." "If it’s a gold mine, we won’t have to worry about money for the rest of our lives, right?" The only downside was that there wouldn’t be much opportunity to relax and enjoy this newfound wealth anytime soon—training awaited them. However, they wouldn’t need to worry about financial obstacles interfering with their training. Ghislain would ensure that funds were allocated to bolster their skills. Suddenly, a thought crossed Leo’s mind, and he asked curiously, "If you leave, where should I send the money?" The Julien Mercenary Corps didn’t have a permanent base nearby. How could they handle such a significant transfer? Even if it was a small territory, a gold mine was a gold mine. Once the territory fully developed, the 30% cut would amount to a substantial sum. It wouldn’t be practical to locate the mercenary group every year for such large payments. Ghislain shrugged and replied, "When we leave, I’ll send someone whenever we need it. Just deduct the agreed amount and handle the logistics." "Understood. But wouldn’t it be easier if you established a base nearby? I could allocate land in the location of your choice." "That’s not a bad idea," Ghislain mused. "But not right now. My friends still need more experience." It wasn’t time to settle down yet. The mercenary group needed to hone their skills and build their reputation while on the move. Even though Ghislain himself had garnered significant fame from this mission, the Julien Mercenary Corps was also starting to earn recognition. Deneb hadn’t been idle either. She had used her divine power to heal and care for the people. Even a small amount of divine power could change lives, as such blessings were rare and priceless. Kyle, who had stood out during the battles, was also becoming well-known. He, Julien, and Deneb were quickly becoming famous figures in the newly reformed Raks territory. Ghislain turned to Leo with a final piece of advice. "If I’m your brother, then my friends are your family too. Especially Julien—make sure you treat him well. Got it?" "Of course, I’ll do that," Leo replied earnestly. Julien and Deneb blushed, slightly embarrassed by the attention. For them, a lord acknowledging their help felt like a heavy burden. But Leo was genuinely grateful. He made a point of expressing his gratitude to each of them. "Thanks to you, I was able to win my first duel. I can’t thank you enough." "Uh… sure…" Julien muttered awkwardly. "And thanks to you, ma’am," Leo said, turning to Deneb. "My father’s condition didn’t worsen, and you cared for the people. I’m deeply grateful." "Ah… well…" Deneb stammered. "And Kyle, thank you as well. Your performance in the second duel was truly inspiring." "Hah! It was nothing. If anyone messes with you, just let me know. I’ll come back and deal with them myself." Unlike the others, Kyle responded with his usual cocky grin. Perched on his shoulder, a newly revived Dark matched his smug expression. The news of the Julien Mercenary Corps forming a brotherly bond with Leo spread quickly. This strengthened Leo’s position significantly. Having witnessed the mercenaries’ prowess, people understood that their alliance with Leo gave him immense power and influence. The relationship wasn’t one-sided, either. The Raks family became a steadfast supporter of the Julien Mercenary Corps whenever they needed help. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement for both sides. "Alright, it’s time for us to leave. Stay in touch." Ghislain was ready to move on to a new region. His goal was to continue building the mercenary group’s strength and reputation. Before their departure, Leo asked Ghislain a question that had been on his mind. "Brother, aren’t you supposed to be a magician?" After all, while Ghislain always carried a staff, he mostly used it to beat opponents senseless rather than casting spells. Ghislain nodded. "That’s right. I’m a magician. Why do you ask?" "Well… I was wondering… which magic tower are you affiliated with? I’d like to make a donation." It was a sincere gesture of gratitude, but Ghislain blinked in confusion. "Magic tower? Me?" "Yes?" "Wait a second." Ghislain immediately reached out to Astion in his consciousness. "Hey, wake up." —Ugh… what? Astion’s drowsy voice answered. Ghislain got straight to the point. "Did you ever train in a magic tower? You said you were from the countryside. If you learned from a host, does that mean you didn’t have a tower?" "That’s right. I didn’t learn in a tower. I was taught magic by my hosts." "Really? Hm… do you have a name for a tower in mind, just in case?" "Why would I? I never had one." "Then I’ll come up with one for you." —What? Why would you name a magic tower I don’t even have? Ghislain chuckled. Astion was clearly the founder of some legendary magic tower. Using its name now seemed like the perfect opportunity. Smirking, Ghislain turned back to Leo with confidence. "I’m not from a magic tower, but I plan to establish one in the future." "Really?" "Yes. Its name will be…" Ghislain’s smirk widened. "The Tower of Radiance." And so, the name of a future legendary magic tower was decided on the spot. *** The Julien Mercenary Corps, now equipped with a generous travel allowance from Leo and sturdy horses, prepared for their journey. Comfort during travel was a priority. Ghislain stroked the mane of one of the horses, murmuring to himself. "I wonder if my dear Gon is doing well." He had spent a significant amount of time in this place, though in reality, only a short period must have passed. “Gon must still be eating and sleeping well,” he thought. Despite the concerns of others, Ghislain remained calm, confident that things were fine back in his original timeline. "After all, I’m not dead, so I’m sure he’s managing just fine. Besides, time flows differently here." With the Cult of Salvation obliterated and the last dragon defeated, there were no immediate threats to the continent. The people he left behind were capable individuals, among the most skilled on the continent. Managing kingdoms and territories should not pose a problem for them. However, one concern lingered in his mind: the adversary's existence. If that enemy were to resurrect, the situation could become unpredictable. "Hmm… perhaps I’ll awaken before he does." Ghislain was certain that Deneb had called him to this world for a reason, possibly to deliver a crucial warning. He also felt instinctively that he’d wake before the adversary’s return. Although, he couldn’t deny that he was inadvertently altering the past little by little. "Well, it’s made things more convenient, hasn’t it?" While traveling, the group resumed their training. Ghislain took every opportunity to challenge—no, push—the trio, training them rigorously. Unlike before, however, the three embraced his teachings with newfound determination. "We must become as strong as Ghislain!" "It’s the only way to save the world!" "And I’ll make a lot of money too!" Their recent experiences had taught them many lessons, the most important being that they needed strength to achieve their goals. During one training session, Julien, wearing a somewhat concerned expression, asked, "Ghislain… are you okay?" "Yeah… I’m fine," Ghislain replied, though blood trickled from his nose, and his complexion looked pale. Julien wasn’t convinced. Ghislain himself understood the cause. "This body… it’s not holding up." Since the body wasn’t truly his, the balance between his mind and the borrowed body was deteriorating. At this rate, he wouldn’t be able to remain in this form for much longer. "I can’t let this happen. I can’t leave this body yet!" He needed to ensure that the trio could stand on their own. He also had to uncover the truth about the events of this era. "If I must… so be it." This was Ghislain, after all—a man who understood the workings of the world and could bend it to his will. He began contemplating a way to temporarily stabilize his condition. "Perhaps it’s time I started learning some magic again." Ghislain always aimed for the highest goals. His immediate target was to master 9th-circle magic. Achieving that level of power would not only stabilize his current situation but also provide him with substantial advantages upon returning to his own reality.
