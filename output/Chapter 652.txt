Ghislain often explained the importance of ambushes to everyone. Most of his victories in war were achieved through ambushes and sudden charges. In terms of ambush tactics, he was considered the best on the continent. "The key to an ambush is to completely defy the enemy's expectations. The success of an ambush depends on three factors." Everyone listened attentively, their eyes sparkling with interest. "First, complete stealth. You must never be seen by the enemy during your approach. Control every sound, every movement, and even your shadow." “Ooooh!” "Second, overwhelming force in an instant. The purpose of an ambush is to leave the enemy no chance to respond. You must overwhelm them in a flash." “Ooooh!” "Third, accurate intelligence. To succeed in an ambush, you must conduct thorough reconnaissance and gather reliable information. A single mistake can ruin the entire operation." “Ooooh!” "Ambushes are a double-edged sword. If successful, they give you a massive advantage, but if they fail, they can put you in a very unfavorable position. That’s why you must also plan for what to do if the ambush fails." “Ooooh!” Ghislain took every opportunity to teach not only the core of ambush tactics but also military strategy to the hero’s party. These individuals would eventually lead the allied forces of humanity. Military strategy couldn’t be neglected. The three eagerly absorbed Ghislain’s lessons, exclaiming in amazement. Military strategy was a high-level discipline usually taught only to nobles or at academies. Astion, on the other hand, never taught them anything about military strategy. To be precise, he himself didn’t know much about it. Unfortunately, no famous commanders had ever possessed his body. The three of them, captivated by Ghislain's advanced military knowledge, studied hard and learned with enthusiasm. “Well, you’ve learned a lot so far, haven’t you? This time, let’s put ambush tactics into practice.” The three nodded energetically at Ghislain’s words. This was their first attempt at an ambush after learning proper military strategy. And now, they were learning firsthand what happens when an ambush fails. "Kill them!" The bandits, veterans of the regular army, had set up watchtowers around the cliffs for surveillance. They knew that skilled knights or mages could come through the cliffs. As the bandits rushed at them, Julien asked in a panic, “Wasn’t this supposed to be an ambush?” Ghislain straightened his back and replied, “When you fail, the lesson imprints itself deeply on your body and mind. We failed to maintain stealth and gather accurate information. I didn’t expect them to have surveillance units here.” “……” The party was left speechless at Ghislain’s brazen attitude, utterly devoid of shame. Still, he was right about one thing: the lesson was crystal clear. It was deeply ingrained in their bodies and minds. The bandits were charging fiercely. The three of them drew their weapons and assumed their stances. Despite being exhausted, they had no choice but to fight with everything they had. Kyle glanced at Ghislain and asked, “Didn’t you say we should have a plan for when the ambush fails?” “Good question. Of course, I did. I’m always a man with a plan.” “Wh-what is it?” Their faces lit up with hope. Ghislain turned to them, grinning mischievously. “We haven’t done the overwhelming force part yet. Just crush them with brute strength.” “……” Wasn’t that supposed to work only if the ambush succeeded? Before they could fully process his words, Ghislain stepped forward. “Alright, let’s begin.” Although Ghislain couldn’t use magic, he could manipulate mana. Fwoosh! Spears of mana, glowing with a clear blue light, materialized. The color was noticeably different from the mana spears he usually used, likely due to using Astion’s mana. “A 5th-circle mage’s mana, huh? There’s quite a bit of it.” More than ten spears of mana formed around Ghislain. The sight made the bandits cry out in alarm. “A mage!” “Kill him first!” “Rush him!” The bandits targeted Ghislain first. A free-roaming mage was too dangerous to leave alone. Ignoring the tense trio behind him, Ghislain surged forward. “Is this lunatic serious? What kind of mage charges in first?!” The bandits sneered and rushed at him, mocking him openly. Thwack! In an instant, the mana spears shot out in all directions. While some knight-level bandits managed to deflect them, the less skilled were struck directly. “Gaaah!” Several bandits fell immediately. The remaining bandits, however, were undeterred. They took advantage of the opening to close in on Ghislain. But Ghislain didn’t flinch. He charged even further into the fray. A mage getting this close to the enemy was reckless by any standard. Yet Ghislain was still smiling, his face filled with anticipation. “Time to loosen up.” The staff in Ghislain’s hands was sleek and straight, inscribed with numerous magical runes. While it was designed to amplify magic, Ghislain didn’t care about such things. He simply swung it like a weapon. Thud! A bandit who got too close took a blow to the face and collapsed. Another bandit swung a large sword at Ghislain. “Die, you bastard!” In that moment, Ghislain’s staff moved like lightning. Thwack! “Urgh!” The end of the staff struck the bandit squarely in the chest, sending him reeling back, coughing up blood. Three more bandits closed in from both sides. Ghislain raised the staff vertically, smashing it down on one bandit’s head. Thwack! Then, he spun the staff, striking the knees of the other two attackers. They screamed as they crumpled to the ground. Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Ghislain’s staff moved like a blur. Bandits stumbled, dropping their weapons or tripping over themselves as they were struck. Whenever there was even a small opening, Ghislain’s staff ruthlessly hammered into their bodies and heads. “Aaagh! Who the hell is this guy?!” “He’s not a mage?” “He’s no mage! It’s all a trick! Everyone, get him!” Amid the chaotic skirmish, the bandits gathered their courage and rushed at Ghislain. In an instant, mana spears materialized around him once more, shooting out. Fwoosh! The bandits were struck down by the spears yet again. “Aaagh!” “He is a mage! He really is!” “What the hell are we supposed to do?!” The bandits were being pummeled relentlessly by Ghislain’s staff and mana spears. They couldn’t even get close. “What the… What is this?” The bandit leader, arriving late, was dumbfounded as he watched the scene unfold. What kind of mage fought like this? He didn’t sense overwhelming power. Ghislain looked small, lean, and unassuming—like someone who spent all his time studying. Yet his men were being systematically taken down by this seemingly frail figure. “What… what kind of technique is that?” Ghislain’s movements were flawless. He blocked every attack with precision, countering immediately with devastating force. The staff spun in his hands, deflecting weapons and striking weak points to incapacitate his foes. Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Ghislain’s staff danced in his grip, simultaneously attacking and defending. Sometimes he gripped the middle of the staff to thrust at close range, other times he used the end to strike distant targets. “This… this is impossible…” The bandit leader was in utter disbelief. As a former knight, he recognized how exceptional Ghislain’s technique was. In fact, it was beyond his comprehension. The hero’s party, too, was utterly captivated, watching Ghislain fight. “Wow…” “Is Astion even capable of moving like that?” “Even if someone else is controlling his body…” To execute such movements, one’s body had to be well-trained. But Astion hated physical exertion. He always preferred to move using magic. Yet, even with his frail body, he was displaying such fluid and powerful motions. The length of the staff compensated for his short arms and legs, turning his small stature into an advantage. He moved so nimbly that the bandits couldn’t close in. “Amazing…” The party watched in awe, mouths agape. Ghislain’s performance was on a completely different level from what they’d seen before. “Forget military strategy; why doesn’t he teach us something like that…” At Kyle's muttering, the other two nodded in agreement. The bandit leader, spotting the three standing frozen in place, roared with veins bulging in his neck. “Kill those bastards first! No, capture them as hostages!” “Yaaahhh!” All the bandits in the camp had now gathered on this side. Besides those fighting Ghislain, dozens still remained. And they all charged at the three. The trio tightened their grips on their weapons, their faces stiffening with tension. Now was not the time to be admiring Ghislain’s fighting. Clang! Julien was the first to step forward, blocking a bandit's axe. Having just climbed up the cliff, his body hadn’t fully regained its strength. That made it all the more critical to avoid any mistakes. ‘One wrong move, and I’ll die.’ Clang! Clang! Clang! Every clash of weapons sent shudders through his body. Despite his exhaustion, Julien focused his concentration to its limit, drawing every ounce of strength he had. To survive, he had to push his senses to their utmost. Deneb and Kyle were no different. This was the first time they’d ever fought in such a drained state. Until now, they had always conserved their strength and moved cautiously, unsure when danger might strike during their wanderings. But due to Ghislain's reckless (?) plan, they had to push themselves to the very edge of their limits. Clang! Clang! Claaang! “What’s with these kids?!” Even as the bandits cornered the trio, they couldn’t help but feel startled. Despite their youth, these three weren’t ordinary fighters. Still, the bandits held the advantage. The trio was struggling just to avoid being surrounded. Inevitably, injuries began to accumulate, and the three were gradually pushed back. ‘Is this the end?’ Julien bit his lip. Though exhausting, the fight felt strangely different. As he poured all his strength into his movements, he felt as though his mind was floating. He could no longer feel his arms moving consciously. It had been so painful, yet suddenly his mind grew clear, and the pain began to fade away. But the enemy was too numerous. His body bore more and more wounds, and the danger only increased. ‘What should I do…?’ Julien tried to back away, searching for another solution. If this continued any longer, he would collapse. At that moment, something burst through the ranks of the bandits. There seemed to be dozens of them. Flap, flap, flap! “What the—?! What are these things?!” Dozens of bluish sparrows(?) flitted among the bandits, disrupting their formation. To make matters worse, the sparrows were loudly squawking. “Behold my grand entrance!” “A-a talking sparrow?!” Several bandits froze in shock at the sight. “Yaaahhh!” Thwack! Taking advantage of the distraction, the sparrows began ramming into the bandits’ faces. “Damn it! What the hell is this?!” With dozens of sparrows darting in from all sides, the bandits swung their weapons wildly, trying to fend them off. The sparrows attacked mercilessly, pecking at their faces with their beaks. The bandits had no choice but to wave their hands or cover their eyes as they stumbled back. While the bandits flailed in confusion, the trio didn’t lose their focus. Seizing the opportunity, they launched a counterattack. Slash! “Gah!” Bandits began falling one by one to Julien’s sword. The same was happening to the ones who had rushed at Kyle. Meanwhile, Deneb moved to the rear, using her divine powers to support the other two. She judged that aiding her exhausted companions would be more effective than engaging in direct combat herself. Her decision proved correct. Fwoosh… Though her divine power was weak, it was enough to heal minor wounds and provide a much-needed boost of vitality. Thanks to her efforts, the two fought with renewed vigor. Slash! Slash! Slash! “Argh!” “You damned brats!” “Someone deal with these blasted sparrows!” The bandits couldn’t concentrate on the fight. The sparrows, seemingly acting on their own judgment, continuously disrupted the bandits’ attacks. Particularly annoying were the sparrows that targeted their eyes, forcing them to cover their faces and retreat. The trio was unsurprised by the sudden appearance of the sparrow swarm. They had already learned about Dark’s existence from traveling with Ghislain. Although they hadn’t expected him to shrink from a crow to a sparrow due to mana depletion, the connection was clear. Thanks to the trio’s efforts and Dark’s intervention, the number of bandits steadily dwindled. ‘We can do this!’ Julien thought as he swung his sword with renewed determination. He didn’t spare a thought for the others; Kyle was surely handling his share just as well. Thunk! With one final thrust, Julien drove his sword into the chest of the last bandit before him. He relaxed for a brief moment, seeing no one left to block his path. And then— Through the collapsing body of the bandit, a twisted face emerged. Deneb’s eyes widened in horror as she screamed. “Julien!” The bandit leader, face contorted in fury, was lunging with his sword aimed straight at Julien’s neck.
