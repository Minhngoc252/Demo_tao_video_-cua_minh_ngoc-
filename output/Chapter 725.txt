Ismoken, after descending the mountain, did not head straight to the battlefield. Instead, he concealed himself once again in a suitable forest. He planned to receive information from the bandits there. The bandits had infiltrated Boneto territory under various disguises—as local residents, as employees of merchant caravans, and as mercenaries. Whenever they heard of work being offered anywhere, they approached without hesitation. Fortunately for them, war had broken out. Most of the soldiers had been conscripted and sent to the battlefield, which had loosened security checks. Due to the war, people and supplies were moving in great numbers across cities and villages. Taking advantage of this, the bandits gathered information from various places without revealing their identities. "Boneto’s army has already set out." "They are moving very cautiously, so their pace is slow." "It seems they are being extra careful to protect their weapons." Not only the bandits but also hidden informants diligently reported to Ismoken. Ismoken merely listened in silence. In truth, war-related information was not his primary concern. His goal was to confirm whether the new weapon was actually being used on the battlefield. Before long, he finally heard the news he had been waiting for. "Boneto's forces have captured Count Schwarz’s first fortress." "Did they use the Empire’s new weapon?" "Yes! Yes! I saw it from afar! There was some kind of operator on top of a cart? It spewed fire! And then—the fortress walls just collapsed!" "…What happened to Schwarz’s forces?" "The operator fired it twice more! Even the magic formations on the walls crumbled! They panicked and retreated! I heard they had heard rumors about the weapon but were still unsure if it was real!" "……" The explanation was crude, but given that the speaker was an uneducated bandit, that was to be expected. The important takeaway was that the weapon was real—and it was indeed powerful. There was something there, that much was certain. He could even go closer to confirm it from a distance. But that alone was not enough. He needed to determine the weapon’s exact structure, the extent of its destructive power, and whether it could be mass-produced. The best method, of course, was to steal the weapon itself. 'How should I go about this…?' If he put his mind to it, he could steal at least one of the weapons. The problem was that in the process, his identity might be exposed. Not only were the territory’s knights and soldiers present, but it was said that the Empire’s secret forces were also there. If they became engaged in battle, someone was bound to realize his true nature. Ismoken pondered for a long time. His identity could not yet be revealed. His allies in other kingdoms were currently causing disturbances. If his cover were blown, their operations could also fail. Thus, even in a small territory like this, he had no choice but to restrain himself and remain hidden. But if everything he had heard about the weapon’s power was true, the war would end much faster than expected. He had to seize it before the Imperial agents left. "…Continue tracking the weapon’s location." After much deliberation, Ismoken decided to wait a little longer. He intended to bide his time until the perfect opportunity arose. For the next few days, he listened to the reports brought in by the bandits while waiting. One thing that irked him was that the bandits were visiting this place more frequently than usual. 'Are they sharing locations too openly?' He had never stayed in one place for so long while receiving reports, so it unsettled him. Just as he resolved to relocate and adjust how the informants delivered their reports, a bandit came rushing in with the information he had been waiting for. "They are moving the weapon in secret!" "…Explain." "Count Schwarz, who kept retreating, has requested reinforcements from nearby territories and the royal family. Count Boneto, upon learning this, is secretly relocating the weapon to launch a surprise attack before the reinforcements arrive!" "……" Ismoken furrowed his brow. The strategy made sense. Ending the war before outside forces could intervene was indeed the best course of action. But the fact that such convincing information had been obtained made it all the more suspicious. No matter how sloppy information control was, it should not be this easy for an external informant to uncover a classified operation. "How did you come by such critical information? This must be a top-secret operation." "O-One of our informants infiltrated as a mercenary and relayed it to us." "…How many soldiers are escorting it?" "No one except the Imperial agents can even approach the weapon. I heard that two hundred members of the Imperial secret forces are transporting it via a detour. The rest of the elite soldiers have already left." "……" Ismoken deliberated once more. The information control was looser than expected. No matter how much they tried to enforce secrecy, information always leaked when it passed through too many hands. Once a rumor spread during wartime, it became uncontrollable. In fact, such weaknesses were often exploited during war. That could be the case now. Since Count Schwarz kept avoiding direct confrontation, Count Boneto might have deliberately spread the rumor to lure him out. However, the information was also extremely tempting. If it was true, stealing the weapon would be easy. 'This is worth trying.' As long as he didn’t reveal his identity, there wouldn’t be an issue. He could watch from a distance and intervene only once he confirmed it wasn’t a trap. "We’re going to steal the weapon." With that, Ismoken and the bandits began moving stealthily. As they left the forest, one of the bandits muttered while looking at a bird perched on a tree. "Wow, a lucky bluebird." The bird was plump and short but had a distinctly blue hue. Another bandit beside him responded. "Huh? I saw one flying around the city too. This region must have a lot of bluebirds." "Yeah, seeing one always gives me a good feeling. I think this job will go well too." The bandits believed it wholeheartedly—without even knowing the truth. They sincerely hoped this would be their last job as they followed the Imperial secret forces. *** Clatter, clatter, clatter. Julien’s mercenary corps was carefully hauling the Dragon Cannon on a wagon. Even the Imperial secret forces had lowered their guard, thanks to the weapon’s overwhelming power. But their true target was someone else entirely. "Do you think he’ll actually show up?" "Who knows… Ghislain said he wouldn’t pass up this opportunity." "And if he doesn’t? What if we miss him?" "Then we keep trying until he does." "……" "Either way, Ghislain is convinced this is the work of a Salvation Order priest. There's no other possibility." Ghislain was certain that a priest from the Salvation Order had manipulated the two territories. He had come to this conclusion based on the reactions of both Count Boneto and Count Schwarz. One of them might have feigned ignorance or outright lied, but given the circumstances, it was undeniable that some unidentified party had gotten involved. Thus, he had gone to great lengths, even spreading false information, to draw them out. Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! Pretending to move stealthily meant they had to travel off-road. The wagon jolted violently, causing the Dragon Cannon to shake along with it. Osvald, noticing this, shouted at Kyle. "Brother! Another chunk of wood fell off with each jolt!" "Ah, that piece of junk, seriously…" As time passed, the Dragon Cannon became more and more grotesque in appearance. By now, calling it a complete piece of trash would not have been an exaggeration. Eventually, every time the mercenaries stopped to rest or eat, they had to repair the Dragon Cannon. It still housed something significant inside, so they couldn't afford for it to break just yet. While the mercenaries were working on its repairs, Dark, his head completely shaved, flew over and perched on Kyle’s shoulder. "Found them. They’re moving right now." "What? Really? You actually found them?" "Of course, nothing escapes my eyes. I had to track every single bastard leaving the city. Thought I was gonna drop dead. You have any idea how much effort it took to create up to Dark Unit No. 57?" "Then can’t we just attack them now?" "No, no. His subordinates are moving first, but the leader is keeping his distance. He’s extremely cautious. And his presence isn’t ordinary either. I didn’t even dare get too close in case he sensed me, so I kept my distance." At Dark’s words, Kyle glanced at Julien. Julien nodded. "Let’s move slowly. Just follow the plan. He’ll show himself soon enough." The mercenaries resumed their march, dragging the Dragon Cannon behind them. They deliberately took secluded paths where no one else would venture. When night fell, the mercenaries settled in a suitable area. They lit torches, posted only a few sentries, and the rest lay down as if to sleep. However, not a single one of them actually slept. This translation is the intellectual property of Novelight. They were all prepared to grab their weapons at any moment. Because they knew an attack was coming. Of course, there was always one clueless fool in every group. "Snore… Kuoooooh… Kuoooooook! Cough! Cough! Grrrrrr…." "……" Aside from Osvald, who had genuinely fallen asleep, the rest were merely pretending. Before long, bandits began gathering around the campsite. Disguised with branches and using the natural terrain to their advantage, they crept closer with silent precision. Pressing their bodies flat against the ground, they slithered forward so discreetly that only the most vigilant would have noticed. They were seasoned raiders, well accustomed to attacking under the cover of night. As soon as they got close enough to strike, they abruptly sprang to their feet. Without a word, they launched their ambush on the mercenaries' camp. The bandits believed they had succeeded. There were only a few guards on duty, and even they seemed drowsy. One of them was even snoring thunderously. However, the moment they swung their weapons, the bandits realized something was terribly wrong. Clang! One of the supposedly sleeping soldiers suddenly lifted his sword and blocked their attack. "Battle formation! We’ve been discovered! Attack now!" At the lead bandit’s cry, the others shouted and charged in aggressively. "Waaahhhhh!" "Kill them all!" The bandits were all disguised as Schwarz soldiers. That way, even if their ambush failed, they could pin the blame on Schwarz’s army. Clang! Clang! Clang! The battle erupted between the mercenaries and the bandits. However, the longer the fight dragged on, the more the bandits were overwhelmed. There were about 100 bandits, whereas the mercenaries numbered 200. From the very start, they were at a disadvantage. Not to mention, in terms of skill, the mercenaries were vastly superior. "The great Osvald! I have not eaten yet!" Even Osvald, who had suddenly woken up, was pummeling bandits left and right in his half-asleep state. But the most fearsome among them were Julien and Kyle. Years of rigorous training and battlefield experience had placed them on the threshold of top-tier swordsmanship. Each time their swords flashed, a bandit’s head flew. Before long, the surviving bandits recoiled in terror. "Shit! What the hell? Why are they so strong?!" "W-We didn’t even kill a single one of them…." "Half of us are already dead…." Julien raised his sword and pointed it at the bandits. "Are you Schwarz’s men? Attacking us unarmed—did you actually think this ambush would work?" The bandits clenched their jaws in frustration. They had only done what they were ordered to do. In truth, they had no idea what was going on. But they couldn’t flee, either. Because someone was watching them from above—preventing them from making a move. As they stood frozen, laughter echoed from the darkness. "To think there are two top-tier knights here… You really must be from the Empire." The voice belonged to Ismoken. He was well aware of Boneto and Schwarz’s military strength. Neither territory possessed top-tier knights. Yet, in the unit transporting the weapon, there were two warriors who had clearly reached that level. Upon seeing them, Ismoken became certain. The Empire had indeed sent their elite to escort the weapon. It was time to act decisively. "You will all die here." "Holy warriors, blessed by the gods, reveal to these heretics the will of the divine." An unidentifiable power resonated in Ismoken’s voice. The bandits who heard him suddenly trembled violently. Fwooooosh… An ominous energy spread through the air. At the same time, the bandits convulsed in pain, their bodies twisting grotesquely. "Guuuuuuh…." Their clothes ripped apart as their bodies grotesquely swelled. Their eyes turned pitch black, and their veins bulged unnaturally. From their mouths, noses, and ears, black smoke billowed like the stench of rotting corpses. They howled as the black mist coiled around them, their bodies mutating into monstrous forms. "Kraaaaaaaagh!" The transformed creatures charged at the mercenaries. BOOOOOM! "Guh…!" The mercenaries, who had raised their weapons to block, staggered backward from the sheer force. The so-called holy warriors had exploded with unnatural vitality, wielding terrifying strength. "Fall back! Form a defensive line!" Julien shouted as he quickly moved to interpose himself between his men and the monstrosities. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Julien and Kyle stood at the forefront, holding the holy warriors at bay. The other mercenaries hastily grouped together into squads to fight. Finally, the battle reached a stalemate. Julien and Kyle focused all their strength on protecting their allies. But the holy warriors were relentless, throwing themselves into battle without regard for their own bodies. Gradually, the mercenaries began to lose ground. And yet, Ismoken did not show himself. He continued watching from the shadows. After all, everyone here had to die. He simply planned to let them wear themselves out before finishing the job. It was a perfect situation. A secluded battlefield with no reinforcements. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! SCREEEEECH! The mercenaries were steadily being pushed back. Focusing purely on defense, they had no choice but to retreat. As a result, the Dragon Cannon was soon left unguarded. Watching the battle unfold, Ismoken paused for a moment. Silencing the Empire’s soldiers was important. But the Empire’s secret weapon was even more important. Staring at the Dragon Cannon, he muttered: "…Is ✪ Nоvеlіgһt ✪ (Official version) this a chicken?" Even Ismoken, who lacked an artistic sense, was baffled. Examining it up close, he frowned. For a weapon created by the Empire, it looked beyond pathetic. It was as if they had intentionally made it this hideous. No matter how clueless he was about aesthetics, this wasn’t right. A weapon’s power was its priority, but the Empire wouldn’t put their name on something this sloppy. Ismoken drew upon his energy. It might really be a trap. Not meant for Schwarz’s forces, but— "Could it be… for me?" At that moment— A massive surge of mana erupted from the Dragon Cannon’s barrel. "KRAAAAAAAAAAAGH!"
