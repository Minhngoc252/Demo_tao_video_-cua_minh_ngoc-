**“We’ve been outmaneuvered!”** A cold sweat trickled down Kaien’s spine. The Fenris mobile forces were renowned for their speed. He had anticipated that they might act independently. However, their numbers amounted to only 20,000. While not insignificant, it wasn’t an overwhelming force. Even if they joined the enemy, it wouldn’t have posed an insurmountable problem. In fact, he had hoped for such a move. It would have been the perfect opportunity to eliminate Count Fenris before the Ferdium forces and the Royal Army arrived. Regrouping forces afterward wouldn’t have been an issue. No matter the losses, taking out that man would have been considered a success. **“But… they struck from behind?”** Mowbray County had remained neutral until now. Despite repeated pressure from the Duke’s faction, the count had firmly declared his intent to side with the victor and sealed his borders. With Mowbray’s strong military, forcing his hand would have been a costly endeavor for the Duke’s faction, so they had left him alone for the time being. Although a monitoring force had been stationed nearby as a precaution, even the Royalist faction hadn’t approached Mowbray. **“No one’s made contact with him… so how did this happen?”** Mowbray had fortified his territory with his own troops. The Duke’s monitoring forces kept a constant watch on them. For Mowbray to suddenly open his gates meant… **“This must have been arranged long before the war began! When could they have met?”** Kaien quickly pieced the situation together. It was clear that Mowbray and Fenris had made an agreement before the war broke out. Otherwise, the count wouldn’t have granted passage so readily. Ghislain had freed Edwin, the son of Count Mowbray, from possession by Dark long ago, forging a bond of loyalty. The Duke’s faction had been completely unaware of this, never imagining that Ghislain would march directly into their territory. Overlooking the southernmost edge of the region had been a grave mistake. They should have forced Mowbray to pick a side, even at the cost of conflict. **“What now?”** The Duke’s territory was left with only 10,000 defenders. While they wouldn’t fall easily—thanks to the presence of Eloise, a 7th-Circle mage, and the many traps he had laid—Kaien still felt uneasy. Count Fenris was known for his unpredictable and unconventional strategies. **“I need to act immediately!”** Allowing Count Fenris to ravage the Duke’s lands was not an option. Even with the mobile forces’ speed, bypassing the southernmost region would take some time. Kaien could intercept them by heading directly south. He turned to Gatros. “You’ll have to hold this position. I need to head south.” “…So they’ve struck from behind. Do you think you can stop them?” “It’s fifty-fifty. Even if I intercept the mobile forces, I might not catch Count Fenris. But it’s better to seize this chance and kill him for good.” “Hmm… Very well. I’ll defend this position as best I can.” Ghislain’s flanking maneuver had turned the tide of the battle. Now, the Duke’s faction had to focus on pinning down the Northern Army at the fortress. If the Ferdium and Royal Armies arrived, the combined forces could sweep through the southern region entirely. Kaien assembled an elite force of 40,000 cavalry. Bringing other troops would slow them down. They needed to move as quickly as possible to intercept the Fenris mobile forces. **“You arrogant bastard… This time, I’ll take your head. Let’s go!”** **Thud, thud, thud, thud!** At Kaien’s furious command, 40,000 Delphine cavalry galloped southward. From atop the fortress walls, Amelia observed their departure, a cold smile playing on her lips. *** “It really happened. I can’t believe it.” Count Mowbray gazed at Ghislain with awe. He had heard of Ghislain’s exploits through rumors. Compared to the brief encounter they’d had when Ghislain was still an exorcist, his reputation had grown immeasurably. Now, Ghislain had toppled the capital, and his father was preparing to ascend as king. In truth, he already held the authority of one. Ghislain smiled warmly at Count Mowbray. “You kept your promise.” Count Mowbray could have chosen to block Ghislain’s advance. His army was well-prepared, having gathered troops in anticipation of the war. He could have broken their agreement and withdrawn entirely, choosing not to take any risks since the conflict with the Duke’s faction hadn’t yet been resolved. But he didn’t. Instead, he pulled back his forces and opened the way for Ghislain. This was why they now stood face-to-face. With his chest puffed out, Count Mowbray declared, “If I intended to break my word, I wouldn’t have made a promise in the first place. I’m not that kind of man.” Beside him stood Edwin, fully armed. The fragile figure from before was gone. Though still somewhat tense, there was life in his eyes. It seemed the physical rehabilitation Ghislain had provided had worked wonders. Spotting Edwin, Dark slithered out and snickered, “Heh, isn’t this my _former_ master? How have you been?” “Ugh…” Edwin grimaced, his discomfort evident as memories of the past came flooding back. While possessed by Dark, Edwin had lived in isolated comfort. But in reality, he’d been nothing more than a beast. Seeing Edwin now fully equipped, Ghislain addressed Count Mowbray. “You don’t need to worry too much. The Duke’s faction will be finished with this battle. If by any chance I lose, you should join the Ferdium forces.” “I will march alongside you,” Count Mowbray replied. “What?” “I can’t sit by and watch the kingdom fall to heresy. While my forces may not match the speed of the Fenris mobile troops, I’ll bring all my cavalry and follow as swiftly as I can.” “Are you sure about this?” “It’s time I made my decision, don’t you think? Besides, someone needs to guide the _other army_ that’s following behind.” Count Mowbray grinned. He couldn’t remain neutral forever. In truth, he had abandoned that stance the moment the Salvation Order began its rise. He had endured the Duke’s pressure and rejected overtures from the Royalist faction, all in preparation for this moment. He had waited, enduring the Duke’s surveillance and political machinations, because he believed Ghislain would come. Advertisements Ghislain smiled in return and nodded. “Good to hear. I’ll be counting on you.” The more troops, the better. The news that Ghislain was bypassing the front lines to attack the Duke’s territory would soon reach Kaien. Ghislain had already eliminated the surrounding surveillance forces. He knew Kaien would immediately move south at breakneck speed upon hearing the news. “Then, I’ll depart first.” “I’ll follow as quickly as I can.” With the help of a guide provided by Count Mowbray, Ghislain and the Fenris mobile forces took the fastest route forward. No one could stop them. The Duke’s faction had already summoned most of their defensive forces, leaving only a skeleton crew behind. **Thud, thud, thud, thud!** This allowed Ghislain and his troops to advance rapidly toward the Duke’s stronghold. The remaining defenders were annihilated in mere moments. Southern lords could do nothing but watch in stunned silence. “Count Fenris has come this far himself?” “How could he move so boldly?” “He’s truly the best at catching people off guard.” Terrified, they locked themselves within their castles, unable to act. Without sufficient forces, they could barely manage their own territories. All they could do was anxiously await the outcome of the war. If the Duke’s faction lost, they knew they would lose everything. News of Ghislain’s approach quickly reached the Duke’s territory. “That damned man… always causing trouble.” Eloise, the Duke’s 7th-Circle mage, stroked his beard and scowled. “Viscount Josef, can the castle hold?” Raul shook his head. “It’s impossible. The Fenris mobile forces have powerful siege weapons. Our weak walls won’t stand a chance.” The Duke’s castle, **Eclipse** , located at the heart of the Duke’s domain, was surrounded by a vast city. But the city walls were built for aesthetic grandeur, offering little real defense. In truth, they had never needed strong walls. Who would dare attack the Duke’s stronghold? Reaching it required breaking through numerous fiefdoms and fortresses, an impossible feat—or so they had thought. But now, there was no one left to stop the army marching toward them. Eloise chuckled bitterly. “Hah, in my eighty years, I’ve never seen such an extraordinary army. That young whelp from the north has become a force to determine the kingdom’s fate.” Raul responded with a grave expression. “You’ll have to fight them directly.” “Yes, I suppose I must. There’s no need to ruin this beautiful place. I never thought I’d have to use _that,_ but it seems I have no choice. Living long enough really does bring surprises.” The Duke’s faction hadn’t been entirely unprepared. As a master of illusion magic, Eloise had been setting traps in the Duke’s domain since his arrival decades ago. The traps, meticulously crafted over years, were capable of neutralizing tens of thousands of soldiers in an instant. “At last, I’ll get to test my masterpiece. If the opponent is a symbol of the kingdom, then it’s a worthy exchange.” Eloise and Raul led 10,000 defenders out to meet the enemy. Advertisements Although outnumbered and outmatched, the defenders didn’t falter. Such was the overwhelming confidence inspired by a 7th-Circle master. The defenders waited at a pre-designated location, a site chosen for its strategic importance. Eloise absentmindedly stroked his beard, a habitual gesture, as he asked Raul, “How long until they arrive?” Despite his lack of military knowledge, Eloise had taken command due to his rank. Fortunately, Raul was there to guide him. “They’ll be here soon.” “Hmm, it hasn’t been long since we received word… Are they really moving that fast? Not just cavalry, but an entire army?” “Their mobility is unparalleled—not just in the kingdom but on the entire continent.” Even while carrying siege weapons, the Fenris mobile forces required no supply lines. No army could match their speed. Their methods remained shrouded in mystery, driving their enemies to madness. Eloise chuckled. “What a shame. They would’ve been such a valuable ally.” “If he were that type, we would’ve persuaded him long ago.” Raul smiled bitterly. At a past banquet, he had broached the subject, but Ghislain had firmly declined. Looking back, Raul couldn’t help but feel regret. **‘Should we have tried harder?’** Could they have turned him to their side if they’d offered all of the north and abundant support? **‘No, that was never an option.’** Even back then, Ghislain had displayed a palpable hostility toward the Duke’s faction—a hostility so overt it was almost baffling. While Raul didn’t fully understand the reasons behind Ghislain’s hatred, he accepted it as fate. **‘Perhaps we were destined to be enemies.’** Shaking off his musings, Raul saw a massive cloud of dust rising in the distance. Eloise, impressed, remarked, “Incredible. They’re truly fast.” While Eloise maintained his composure, Raul scanned the area and barked orders. “Prepare for battle!” **Clang! Clang! Clang!** The defenders raised their shields and leveled their spears. The 10,000 defenders were all infantry, far fewer than the Fenris mobile forces. Even though they were elite, they would be overwhelmed if the charge wasn’t stopped. **Thud, thud, thud, thud!** Ghislain, showing no intention of slowing down, continued his relentless advance. Advertisements “Break through! Crush them in one sweep!” **Clang! Clang! Clang!** At Ghislain’s command, the knights at the vanguard lowered their glowing spears. Their charge would shatter the enemy’s formation in an instant. **Clang! Clang! Clang!** Behind them, the rest of the cavalry spread out, ready to exploit the breach and obliterate what remained. It was a simple, brutally effective tactic. The only requirement was overwhelming power. This was Ghislain’s signature strategy—direct, devastating, and nearly unstoppable. **Thud, thud, thud, thud!** As the mobile forces thundered toward them, Raul swallowed hard, mirroring the anxiety of the defenders. No army could withstand this charge. “Master Eloise, we must…” “Relax, relax. Don’t worry.” Eloise, the only one unfazed, slowly extended his hand. His magic seeped into the ground, activating the hidden magic circles buried beneath the battlefield. **Zing—!** The ground began to glow as the magic circles, laid over decades, sprang to life. Amplifying Eloise’s 7th-Circle magic by hundreds of times, the enchantments blanketed the battlefield. “Enjoy your sweet dreams.” A soft hum accompanied the rise of glittering particles from the earth. They drifted toward the charging cavalry, shimmering as they sank into their bodies. The particles filled the air, splitting and multiplying until the entire area sparkled like a surreal, ethereal wonderland. To the Fenris forces, however, it was anything but enchanting. **Clop, clop, clop…** The galloping horses slowed. Their eyes glazed over, and their mouths slackened. The same happened to the knights and soldiers atop them. “Aah…” The once unstoppable momentum vanished in an instant. The troops stared blankly into the distance, their focus lost. Each man and woman saw something different—scenes from their childhood, loved ones long gone, distant parents, delicious feasts, or moments of personal triumph. Immersed in their own illusions, they became oblivious to the battlefield. **“Tch!”** Some higher-ranking knights bit their lips hard enough to draw blood, resisting the enchantment. But even they couldn’t move, trapped in a liminal space between reality and illusion. Watching the disoriented mobile forces, Eloise smiled. Advertisements “I’ll handle Count Fenris myself. Can you deal with the rest?” “Leave it to me.” Raul nodded, his face alight with confidence. Killing foes who were practically asleep posed no challenge. This was true magic—a force that could overturn the tide of battle in an instant. Years of preparation and vast resources had paid off. **Thud, thud, thud!** Only Ghislain continued charging, a lone figure at the vanguard. Raul, emboldened, shouted, “Attack! They’re nothing but scarecrows now!” The defenders surged forward with newfound courage. Facing an enemy that couldn’t resist, they had no reason to fear. Watching the advancing defenders, Ghislain smirked. “As expected of the kingdom’s greatest mage.” Had he been unprepared, his forces would have been wiped out. Without mages to counter the spell or protect his troops, they would have fallen helplessly. But bringing mages would have slowed their pace, giving the enemy even more time to prepare. In the end, Eloise’s magic was an unavoidable hurdle. However, Ghislain had anticipated this trap and come prepared. “Dark!” Ghislain’s voice boomed across the battlefield like thunder. **Fwoosh!** Black energy erupted from his body, surging outward. Dark consumed half of Ghislain’s mana in an instant, coalescing into a massive, shadowy figure above the battlefield. Eloise’s eyes widened in shock. “What… what is that?” No one could answer. None had seen anything like it before. Then, Ghislain’s voice rang out again, commanding the battlefield. “Awaken!” **Boom—!** Dark’s shadowy form exploded outward, enveloping the entire Fenris mobile force.
