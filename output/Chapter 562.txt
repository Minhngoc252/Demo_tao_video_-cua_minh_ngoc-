Ghislain immediately issued new instructions to the allied commanders. “We’ll split our forces as well. However, we won’t chase after the enemy. Instead, we’ll focus on securing key strongholds and encircle the area broadly.” The commanders looked uneasy, biting their lips. It was clear that the enemy was targeting their supply lines. Dividing their forces to intercept made sense, but the allied army's strength lay in its overwhelming numbers. Splitting up would mean giving up that advantage. Marquis Gideon voiced his concern with a worried look. “The Salvation Order has many superhumans. Splitting our forces could put us at a disadvantage. Is there no other way?” “There isn’t. The enemy is clearly aiming to starve us out. If they target the supply lines, they’re trying to wear us down.” The Marquis of Suffolk, who had once been aided by Ghislain in Parsalli, offered an alternative. “Then wouldn’t it be better to defend the supply lines with as many troops as possible? If we outnumber them, it’ll be easier to hold our ground.” The idea made sense—identify where the enemy was targeting and defend it. However, Ghislain shook his head firmly. “Why do you think the enemy split their forces so broadly? They’re not just targeting the supply lines.” “Then what…?” “They’re baiting us to split up and fight. If we don’t respond, they’ll leave Grimwell and attack another kingdom.” “…” Everyone frowned deeply at Ghislain’s words. It was plausible, but what if his judgment was wrong? What if this was a feint? Once split, regrouping would be extremely difficult. If the enemy’s movements were a bluff, the allied forces would suffer a major setback. Wiping sweat from his brow, the Marquis of Suffolk asked nervously. “Are you… absolutely certain? If you’re wrong, we’ll be in real trouble. Wouldn’t it be safer to defend the supply lines for now and watch their movements?” “I’m certain.” “How can you be so sure?” “Because that’s what I would do.” “…” The marquis wanted to retort, _“And who exactly are you?”_ But considering Ghislain’s reputation for strategy, questioning him outright was difficult. Ghislain continued his explanation. “The enemy has nothing to defend here anymore. They no longer need to move as one large army. There’s no reason for them to risk a decisive battle and take massive casualties.” He looked around at the gathered leaders and spoke resolutely. “The enemy intends to use their mobility to harass us—just like before.” The Salvation Order had plunged the continent into chaos with uprisings in various regions. The sheer scale of the conflict had made it impossible to respond quickly. This time, the same strategy was being applied, but on a military scale. Ghislain explained further. “If we delay and only defend the supply lines, they’ll leave this kingdom and strike elsewhere. That would cause even greater chaos and division.” The Marquis of Suffolk frowned, visibly frustrated. “And you’re saying we should just play into their hands?” “Yes. For now, it’s better to let them think they’re succeeding. The enemy has two choices, after all.” Ghislain’s reasoning was simple. If the enemy was baiting them into battle, it was better to engage now on their terms. It was a sound argument. If the allied homeland was attacked, the forces would have no choice but to scatter in pursuit of the enemy. The thought of such a future made the commanders’ faces pale. _“It’s easy to say, but can they really pull this off?”_ _“It’s impossible without exceptional leadership and coordination.”_ _“Do they really have that kind of capability?”_ Many remained doubtful. So far, victories had come relatively easily, and it was hard to believe the enemy was capable of such precision. Having many superhumans was one thing, but commanding such a divided army effectively was another matter entirely. Still, they all agreed on one thing: they couldn’t allow the enemy’s plan to succeed, no matter how unlikely it seemed. Ghislain scanned the room and spoke firmly. “You understand the situation, don’t you? Now, I’ll tell you what we need to do.” The commanders nodded. While surprised by the enemy’s bold strategy, they couldn’t deny its brilliance. _“Whoever’s leading them is bold and reckless, yet remarkably skilled.”_ _“Splitting their forces in a war of this scale… That’s insane.”_ _“This is incredible. Even knowing it’s a trap, we have no choice but to respond. Can we really win this?”_ As they pondered, Ghislain pointed at various locations on the map. “We’ll abandon three of the supply lines. We’ll only defend one. The rest of you will hold key strongholds and prevent the enemy from escaping. Your job is to hold your ground.” The sudden declaration shocked the allied leaders. “Abandon the supply lines?” “Why? If we know they’re targeting them, why give them up?” “I thought the whole point was to stop them!” But Ghislain answered calmly, as if it were no big deal. “We need to bait them. If they think they’re succeeding, they’ll gain confidence and push harder to defeat us. You all know the enemy isn’t ordinary, right?” “…” The enemy’s strategy was unconventional, but Ghislain’s was equally daring. Both sides were playing an exceptionally dangerous game. Marquis Gideon wiped his brow nervously and asked. “So, we’re just supposed to defend the strongholds?” “Yes. The enemy will continue using mobility to drag this out.” Another commander spoke up with a worried expression. “What if we fail to hold the strongholds and they break through?” “Even if that happens, the enemy won’t leave the kingdom immediately. They’ll focus on reducing our forces while we’re divided.” “Hmm, I see…” “If they try to leave, it’ll exhaust their already limited supplies. For them, the ideal outcome is wiping us out within Grimwell.” Ghislain spoke with such confidence that it seemed like he knew the enemy’s mind. Marquis Gideon, feeling reassured, asked hopefully. “Understood. So we’ll secure the strongholds and block their escape. But who will pursue and fight them?” “Fenris’s mobile unit and I will handle that… along with Julien.” Ghislain glanced at Julien and grinned. Julien simply nodded without hesitation. He had the ability and confidence to execute any strategy flawlessly. “No probRem.” Ghislain smiled in satisfaction. _Truly a dependable man._ “You heard him. The two of us will hunt them down. The rest of you just need to hold your positions.” If the enemy relied on speed and numbers, they would do the same. It would actually make things easier. The commanders understood but still looked uneasy. While Julien and Fenris were undeniably powerful, the prospect of facing the Salvation Order’s superhumans without their support was daunting. Noticing their anxiety, Ghislain clicked his tongue and said. “We’ll reinforce your forces. Claude, send messengers to the surrounding kingdoms and tell them to bring every available soldier.” “Every soldier…?” “If we lose here, the other kingdoms are finished anyway. Spare no effort. Tell them to hurry. If they delay, they’ll be invaded.” “Understood.” The enemy was strong, so they needed even greater numbers to hold the line. Reinforcements would also ease the commanders’ concerns. But Ghislain wasn’t done yet. “And bring in all the mercenaries from every region. Not a single one is to be left out.” The allied leadership’s expressions darkened again. Other kingdoms relied on mercenaries to keep their economies afloat. Without them, their fragile states would collapse entirely. Marquis Gideon asked cautiously. “Do we really need the mercenaries too?” “We need overwhelming numbers to create an impenetrable line. That’s the only way to trap and crush them.” “…” Not even one of those cockroach-like bastards would escape. Ghislain was genuinely determined to completely eradicate the Salvation Order here. His resolute determination spread to everyone present. Having entrusted this war to him, no one dared to oppose him. Even if they did, Ghislain wouldn’t listen anyway. “Then let’s reorganize the forces immediately. I will assign your positions. We need to move as quickly as possible.” Ghislain would lead the Fenris Mobile Unit of 20,000 troops, while Julien would take command of 20,000 of the most elite cavalry selected from the allied forces. The remaining forces, including the Ruthania army, were split into six corps, each consisting of approximately 30,000 to 50,000 soldiers. Thus, a total of eight corps were formed. Though fewer in number compared to the enemy divisions, the lack of superhumans meant they had to allocate more troops to each unit. With reinforcements and mercenaries on the way, they could increase their numbers further. The allied commanders, who had looked uneasy just moments before, now clenched their fists and shouted energetically. “Well, since it’s come to this, let’s crush them for good this time!” “That’s right! How much longer are we going to let them lead us by the nose?” “Finally, peace will return to the continent!” Everyone knew that fear would get them nowhere. With promises of reinforcements, their morale had been lifted. The best course of action now was to gather their strength and stop the enemy. As the commanders reaffirmed their resolve, Ghislain spoke. “Reach your designated strongholds as quickly as possible and establish defensive positions. The enemy doesn’t yet know where we’ll move, so they’ll likely wait and observe our movements first.” The commanders all nodded. There were plenty of strongholds from which the enemy could escape to other kingdoms. If they truly intended to pick the allied forces apart, they would first wait to see where the allies moved before acting. Once the meeting ended, Marquis Gideon suddenly spoke in a tone of confusion. “By the way, where are the ‘war record scribes’ today?” The scribes who always clung to Julien, recording his every move, were nowhere to be seen. Ghislain tilted his head at that comment. Of course, the allied army had its own record-keepers. However, they never participated in crucial strategic meetings. Instead, they would record events only after receiving reports of the battles. This was a standard precaution to prevent spies. Marquis Gideon, who surely knew this fact, sounded as if it were natural for scribes to be present. It was odd. “Why are you mentioning scribes now…?” At that moment, Claude burst forward with exaggerated urgency. “Come on, let’s move already! The enemy is probably on the move right this second! This meeting has gone on too long! Everyone, you need to move immediately!” _Is this bastard up to something weird again?_ Something felt very suspicious. Ghislain immediately turned his gaze toward Wendy. Wendy widened her eyes and shook her head furiously, signaling that she didn’t know anything. Before Ghislain could ask more, Claude began making a commotion again. “Oh, we’re so busy! So busy! Come on, everyone, hurry up and move! I’ll handle the reinforcements as quickly as possible!” Claude was practically pushing the commanders out of the room. No one dared defy him since he was the so-called “second-in-command” of the Ruthania forces. Reluctantly, the commanders let themselves be herded away. Ghislain narrowed his eyes and stared at Claude. “What?” Claude asked nervously. “…” “Why are you looking at me like that?” “…It’s nothing.” “Then I’ll get going. Busy, busy!” “Wait a moment.” “What now?” Claude groaned, looking around nervously. Ghislain glanced around the room before speaking in a low voice. “I have an additional operation for you.” “What? Now?” The strategy had already been set, and the commanders had left to carry out their assignments. Why was Ghislain now telling him something privately? Ghislain approached Claude. The latter instinctively tried to back away, but Ghislain caught him quickly. Then, he leaned in and whispered something into Claude’s ear. Claude blinked in confusion and repeated what he heard. “Really? Like that?” “Yes, proceed exactly that way.” It was strange to hide this even from their own allies. That meant there was a reason. Claude narrowed his eyes and asked cautiously. “You’re keeping this secret because…?” Ghislain nodded. “Exactly. There’s still something suspicious left.” Count Vipenvelt was a master strategist. And a brilliant strategist never relied on just one plan. Ghislain was certain the enemy had something else hidden. Now, he was preparing to uncover that as well.
