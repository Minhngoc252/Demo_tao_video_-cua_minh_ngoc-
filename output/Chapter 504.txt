The Fenris Territory had been constantly developing over the years. Numerous academies were established, child labor was banned, and enormous funds were invested into welfare policies. All of these efforts were aimed at cultivating a powerful military force. As a result, healthy young adults consistently enlisted in the army, and Fenris’s productivity skyrocketed. The policies that had been aggressively implemented long ago were finally bearing fruit. These same policies were applied in Ferdium as well. Ghislain had supported Ferdium, encouraging them to adopt policies as close as possible to Fenris's model. Thanks to these measures, Ferdium had managed to gather a formidable force, one that would have been unthinkable for other territories. Their military had grown to an impressive 30,000. At this pace, they could likely build an army exceeding 50,000 within a few years. The once-small frontier territory, with barely 5,000 troops, had now developed military strength worthy of being called a great dominion. Moreover, thanks to the mana cultivation techniques provided by Ghislain, the number of knights had risen to over 200. Knights and soldiers equipped with Galvanium gear possessed combat power several times that of other territorial forces. This formidable force was now advancing toward the capital, disregarding everything else. When Ghislain heard the news, he smirked. "That’s just like Father." Even though Ghislain had informed Zvalter about what needed to be prepared, Zvalter had moved ahead without waiting. It was clear he could no longer bear to watch the suffering of the people. "It can’t be helped. I’ll just have to handle the rest myself." Simply storming in, defeating the king, and declaring oneself the ruler wouldn’t automatically grant acceptance. After toppling the royal family, they needed to be prepared to govern immediately. They also had to secure the support of other nobles. Only then could the kingdom move forward without fracturing in the ensuing chaos. Given the dire state of affairs, gaining the nobles’ support wouldn’t be too difficult. The main issue remained the Duke’s house. "Move the allied forces and the western army to the southern front. The moment the Duke's house hears of Ferdium’s deployment, they’ll act immediately. The northern army will merge with Ferdium’s forces." The western region was being managed by Count Selburk, who, along with Fenris administrators, had stabilized the area and amassed a force of approximately 50,000. Though modest compared to what could be gathered from the entire western region, it was a miracle considering the devastation the area had previously suffered. The western army was now under the command of Tenant, who had been dispatched earlier by Ghislain. Combined with the remaining allied forces, which numbered about 100,000, they would provide significant support. "As for the central and eastern regions… it’s uncertain how the remaining lords will respond." Those regions were well aware that the royal family and the Duke’s house had aligned. Many were likely to bide their time, carefully observing the situation. Even though the northern army was formidable, it was impossible to predict the outcome of a confrontation with the Duke’s house. Ultimately, they needed to dismantle the royal family while holding off the Duke’s advance. Only then would the remaining nobles rally to their cause. The problem was that the western army and the allied forces alone wouldn’t be enough to stop the Duke’s main forces. "Gillian, lead the northern army to the southern front. I’ll take the mobile unit and join Ferdium." "Understood." The plans had already been meticulously crafted. Gillian, along with Ereneth, Parniel, and Vanessa, would head to the southern front. Such power was necessary to counter the superhumans of the Duke’s house. Ghislain had considered sending Belinda as well, but she had vehemently opposed it, insisting on staying by his side. Piote, the priestly order, Kaor, and the assault force were also sent to the southern front. Among the assault force were new faces. “Where are we going?” “Why are we even here?” “Where’s the squad leader… I mean, Count Fenris?” The remnants of the Kingdom Army’s 2nd Corps, 3rd Infantry Company, who had narrowly escaped, found themselves roped into the assault force without knowing why. Claude accompanied Ghislain, intending to assist in governance after they seized the capital. Ghislain and the Fenris mobile unit quickly joined Ferdium’s forces marching toward the capital. When Zvalter saw Ghislain, he smiled warmly. "Apologies, my body was itching to move." Ghislain returned the smile, shaking his head. "It’s nothing. I felt the same way, Father." While it was true they could have used more preparation, moving now wasn’t a bad idea. Berhem’s tyranny had escalated dramatically. If they had waited longer, allowing Berhem and the nobles to commit even more atrocities, it would have made overthrowing the royal family easier. The more the people suffered, the more fervently they would desire a new leader. But neither Zvalter nor Ghislain were the type to stand by and watch such horrors unfold. The news that Ferdium had drawn its sword against the royal family spread quickly. It was impossible to hide the movement of such a large army, and they had intentionally spread messages to inspire hope among the people. Before Zvalter departed, he sent proclamations to lords and nobles across the kingdom. **[…The king has now aligned with the Salvation Order, transforming into a mad tyrant. Under his brutal reign, the kingdom is crumbling into ruin. Only those unworthy of the title of noble remain by his side. For the future of the kingdom, for the oppressed people, and to restore the honor of trampled nobles, I rise in rebellion. I appeal to you all. In this dark age, let us unite…]** Unlike Ghislain, Zvalter’s approach was heartfelt and sincere. His lengthy proclamation called for collective action for the kingdom’s future. He sought to persuade with genuine intent, asking for their support. The proclamations weren’t limited to the nobles—they were distributed widely, reaching commanders in the Kingdom Army as well. Before long, extraordinary events began to unfold. Junior officers in the Kingdom Army began defecting, leading their soldiers with them. "I can’t stay here any longer." "We’re going to die anyway, so what does it matter?" "Better to fight the mad king than Ferdium." With desertions increasing, the Kingdom Army found themselves preoccupied with monitoring their own soldiers. Fear of fighting Ghislain played a role, but more significantly, despair at the kingdom’s lack of a future drove them. They chose instead to align with Ferdium, which promised a new era. Those who successfully defected gravitated toward Ferdium’s forces, where Zvalter welcomed them with open arms. Incorporated into Ferdium’s ranks, they marched together toward the capital. **Advertisements** Growing steadily as they advanced, Ferdium’s forces were intercepted by the Kingdom Army’s 3rd Corps. The new commander of the 3rd Corps, Count Makid, stood with an air of arrogance. "The northern army is largely absent! This is a winnable battle!" Even though Ferdium had grown stronger, in his mind, they were still just a poor, insignificant border force. Furthermore, only 20,000 northern troops had joined Ferdium’s ranks, leaving their total strength comparable to the 3rd Corps. Commanding a large army for the first time, Count Makid was brimming with enthusiasm. "I’ll crush them with my brilliant strategy." He envisioned his reputation spreading across the kingdom. He had always resented the praise given to Count Fenris, dismissing it as undeserved. By defeating Ferdium’s forces, he could simultaneously prove his own competence and expose the so-called hero’s false reputation. Unlike the overconfident Count Makid, his soldiers wore grim expressions. The 3rd Corps had fought alongside Fenris in the past and were well aware of Ghislain’s power. "Count Fenris is a monster." "He could kill half of us on his own." "His knights and soldiers are unbelievably strong." Having fought beside him for years, they knew the truth. They had no desire to face him in battle. Count Makid frowned at the unsettling mood among his troops. "What are you all doing? Are you cowed by a mere legend?" The soldiers glared at him in return. "Pathetic fool. He doesn’t know anything." "He’s never commanded an army before. He’s desperate for fame." Before Makid could address the strange atmosphere further, Zvalter emerged from Ferdium’s ranks. **Clip-clop, clip-clop.** Riding forward at a slow pace, he shouted, "I have no desire to fight you!" "What is he saying?" Count Makid frowned deeply. If they intended to surrender, why waste time with all this grandstanding? Zvalter, his voice heavy with authority, continued. “I will hold the king accountable for his crimes. You have merely followed orders. If you lay down your arms and surrender now, I will accept you all!” Count Makid, enraged, shouted back. “Silence! How dare you, a traitor, spew such nonsense? If you do not surrender immediately, you will die a miserable death!” “My words are not for scum like you!” Zvalter’s eyes burned as he fixed his gaze on Makid. “They are for the soldiers who still strive to protect this kingdom!” “You insolent bastard… How dare a mere frontier dog speak to me like this…” Makid trembled with fury. For someone favored by the king, being addressed this way was intolerable. Already irritated by the recent successes of those crude northerners, Makid issued his order. “Attack! Kill him immediately!” The soldiers raised their weapons as trained, but their morale had already been crushed. In the midst of the tense standoff, one soldier suddenly dropped his weapon and knelt. “I surrender!” All eyes turned to the soldier. What foolishness was this? To kneel before the battle had even begun? Makid, already furious, could not let such defiance go unpunished. “Kill him at once!” Even before the first blow had been struck, this humiliation undermined the entire army. Not only was it disgraceful, but it also threatened to further erode the soldiers’ already fragile morale. The defiant soldier had to be dealt with immediately. But no one moved to execute the order. Instead, other soldiers followed suit, throwing down their weapons and kneeling. “I don’t want to fight Ferdium!” “Why should we fight our own?” “This damned kingdom! Kill me if you must, but I’m done!” More and more soldiers dropped their weapons, each shouting out their frustrations. To them, it didn’t matter whether they died here or elsewhere. Fighting for a rotten kingdom was not how they wanted to meet their end. This was the soldiers’ honest sentiment. Count Makid’s face turned red as he trembled with anger. This was a loss before the battle had even begun. If the enemy attacked now, there would be no way to defend against it. Fortunately for Makid, Zvalter simply observed. “Disciplinary officers! What are you waiting for? Kill those cowards now!” The disciplinary officers scattered throughout the ranks hesitated, lowering their heads in silence. Their duty was to kill deserters or disobedient soldiers. But in this moment, they had no desire to carry out such orders. They, too, were disgusted by the atrocities committed by the king and the nobles. **Clang.** Weapons slipped from their hands and fell to the ground. One by one, the disciplinary officers also knelt. The wave of surrender spread indiscriminately through the army. Soldiers, private guards, and even junior officers all knelt, one after another. Even the less perceptive among them could see how this was going to end. “You… you scum…” Makid shook with disbelief. Who had ever heard of a commander losing before a single blow was struck? Yet that was now his reality. Desperate, he turned to the knights near him. “Kill them! Kill them all immediately!” With his entire army surrendering, fleeing wasn’t even an option anymore. Yet rather than attempting to escape, Makid demanded that his knights slaughter the soldiers. Blinded by rage, he had lost all capacity for rational thought. The knights stared coldly at Makid. This man wasn’t even a proper commander. He was a drunkard and a womanizer who spent his time idling in the camp. He used military discipline as an excuse to punish and torment the soldiers under him. Many soldiers and even civilians had died because of him. None of the knights who had been forced to serve under Count Makid would follow him now. When the knights refused to act, Makid began to panic. “You… you wretches! Why aren’t you obeying my orders?” Only the knights loyal to his family drew their swords, though they did so hesitantly. In an instant, it became clear that everyone present was now his enemy. Zvalter rode forward alone, his presence commanding. Makid shouted at his personal guards. “Capture him! Now!” This was his chance. If he could take the Margrave of Ferdium hostage, he might still turn the situation around. But his guards couldn’t move. **Clang! Clang! Clang!** Instead, the knights of the Kingdom Army drew their swords and surrounded Makid. “What… what are you doing? You’re my soldiers! Do you intend to commit treason?” Makid’s face turned pale as he screamed. But the knights remained silent, pointing their blades at him. Zvalter spoke with unyielding authority. “Arrest him.” At his command, the knights moved swiftly, overwhelming Makid and his guards. The guards immediately dropped their weapons, surrendering without a fight. “You bastards! Do you think you’ll get away with this? The king will… mmph!” Makid’s protests were silenced as he was gagged and forced to his knees. Without a single battle, the 3rd Corps had fallen. **Shing…** Zvalter dismounted and drew his sword. He had risen in rebellion to purge those who had corrupted the kingdom. This was something he needed to do himself. His expression resolute, Zvalter swung his blade. **Slash!** Makid’s head fell in one clean stroke. Blood dripped from the blade as Zvalter held it aloft, addressing the soldiers. “Rise and take up your weapons!” The soldiers picked up their discarded weapons and stood, their expressions brighter than before. Zvalter looked upon them with satisfaction and declared, “If you wish to save this kingdom, join me!” A deafening cheer erupted. “Waaaaaaah!” Even common soldiers understood that the kingdom had gone astray. Even common soldiers knew what they were fighting to protect. This was the fight they wanted to take part in. Ferdium and Fenris represented the cause they believed in. With that, Zvalter absorbed the 3rd Corps into his ranks and continued the march. The armies that stood in their way surrendered one by one. As their numbers swelled, Ferdium’s advance slowed, but with every step, they gained momentum and weight. This army, more than any other, could truly be called the army of a rightful king.
