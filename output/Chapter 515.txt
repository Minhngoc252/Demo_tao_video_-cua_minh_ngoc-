Kaien stared blankly at Ghislain. "The King of Mercenaries, huh..." If it were any other time, he would have simply laughed. The title of "king" was not something just anyone could use. No matter how powerful one might be, they wouldn’t dare call themselves a king. Even the most influential dukes of the kingdom, or even Marquis Branford, never dared. But now, he couldn’t dismiss Ghislain’s words as a mere joke. “Waaaahhhhh!” “Captain! We’re here!” “Commander! Are you alright?” Dominic shouted loudly as he rushed forward, followed by the Drake Mercenary Corps and mercenaries gathered from various kingdoms. Their number was a staggering 50,000. Such a force couldn’t be hired in one go, even by the Ruthania Kingdom. The King of Mercenaries. Kaien gazed at them with exhausted eyes, lost in thought. The other kingdoms weren’t in good shape either. Yet, at Ghislain’s command, such a massive force had gathered. Truly, it wasn’t an exaggeration to call him the King of Mercenaries. If someone like him wasn’t a king, then who could claim the title? We’ve... never truly understood that man. Mercenaries were scattered everywhere, and so they had paid them little attention. No matter how much the Fenris Mercenary Corps expanded its influence, they thought it was insignificant. To them, mercenaries were merely tools to be used and discarded. But to think they would eventually be caught off guard by those very mercenaries. So his policies were truly effective after all. They were well aware that the Count of Fenris poured a tremendous amount of money into the mercenaries. Even though they knew he had agreements with kingdoms and showered benefits upon the mercenaries, they assumed he was simply inflating his numbers. But look—these mercenaries had come with confidence, their expressions brimming with determination to save their leader. Among them, there were likely those who didn’t even know who the Count of Fenris truly was, or who had been swept up in the momentum. However, their leaders were different. Without a high level of loyalty, no mere band of mercenaries would charge in like this. At the very least, the sense of belonging to the Fenris Mercenary Corps had clearly been solidified. This wasn’t something that could simply be admired. Plans had been thwarted by the Count of Fenris multiple times. Each time, they adjusted their strategy, reevaluating his abilities. But even that had been arrogance. He wasn’t someone to be merely assessed and dealt with. We should have approached him as challengers. That’s what they should have done—faced him as a challenger. Just like when they confronted the Shadow Knight Commander, a figure so feared by the king and the Salvation Order. They should have given it their all from the very beginning. But now it was too late. Far too late. That beautiful ducal castle would soon be trampled beneath the hooves of his horse. Kaien exhaled roughly, once again raising his sword. “Fine, then. We’ll settle this.” His army was already completely surrounded. The enemy radiated a wild ferocity, ready to charge at any moment. If they started the battle like this, they would be annihilated without even putting up a fight. If there was any hope of a miracle... The only option was to kill that man and raise their morale. Ghislain met Kaien’s gaze with a savage grin. “That’s right. It wouldn’t sit well for you to carry the title of the Kingdom’s Greatest Sword without proving yourself.” In truth, he could retreat right now. He could leave the finishing blow to others. But Ghislain didn’t. A life-or-death duel was the best way to surpass one’s limits. Opportunities like this didn’t come often in life. That’s why he had to surpass this man with his own strength. No further words were needed. Thud. Both men stepped forward at the same time. Ignoring defense altogether, they swung their swords at each other. Slash! “Agh!” It was unclear whose cry it was. Both spewed blood as they staggered back, their bodies battered to the point it was a wonder they could still move. Neither stopped swinging their swords at each other, their expressions twisted into something almost demonic as they glared at one another. “Huff, huff…” Thud! Both collapsed to the ground simultaneously, as if they had planned it. Yet, they gritted their teeth, forcing themselves to rise and swing their swords once more. Slash! Slash! The sound of flesh being torn echoed relentlessly, and blood splattered everywhere. Defense seemed to be a forgotten concept. Neither side’s soldiers knew whether they should intervene or simply watch. Eventually, Dominic drew his sword. “Commander, stop! It’s too dangerous!” Count Mowbray raised his hand, signaling his troops to move. It was becoming too dangerous. If this continued, Ghislain could lose his life from excessive blood loss. But Ghislain pointed his sword at Dominic and growled. “Don’t... move. It’s... over now.” Blood trickled from his mouth every time he spoke, yet he still wore a smile. Kaien was no different. He laughed as he glared at Ghislain. “Ha... haha... you bastard...” He had never fought this fiercely in his life. If he could win and survive this battle... “I’ll kill you and surpass my limits once more.” “That’s what I should be saying.” Swoosh! The two swords moved toward each other again, now devoid of mana. The blows were so weak they wouldn’t even kill a regular soldier. Clang. Their swords collided. This seemingly meaningless act repeated itself several times. Clang, clang, clang. The metallic sound gradually faded, eventually ceasing altogether as silence fell over the battlefield. Neither moved, their swords locked together. Ghislain slowly opened his mouth. “I’ve won.” “…” Kaien said nothing. Blood still trickled from his lips as he glared at Ghislain. Rumble... Ghislain sent the last remaining traces of mana into his five cores. That faint power coursed through the cores, gradually amplifying. Crack! Even after amplification, the power was weaker than what a typical knight could produce. But Ghislain’s body couldn’t handle even that. His exhausted muscles immediately twisted, and his wounds tore open, causing blood to gush out. Even so, Ghislain gritted his teeth and swung his sword. Boom! Kaien blocked it. But the force sent his body staggering. Ghislain swung again. Boom! Boom! Boom! Once, twice, three times... Each swing forced Kaien to retreat further, unable to withstand the power. Kaien, his vision blurring, watched as the sword approached. He raised his own to block it, but a sense of finality washed over him. A sword. The sword was his world. And now, another sword was about to shatter that world. Ah… He had finally glimpsed the world beyond. Clang! Crack! Kaien’s sword, which had blocked Ghislain’s strike, shattered. It was as if Kaien’s world had crumbled along with it. Through the scattering fragments, he saw Ghislain’s eyes. Eyes still burning with fury and murderous intent. Why are you... Slash! Kaien couldn’t finish his thought. This time, Ghislain’s sword struck deeply, cutting through his body. “Gah!” From his collarbone to his side, Kaien was sliced open. Blood gushed as he staggered. But he didn’t fall. He remained standing, his feet planted firmly, staring at Ghislain. Ghislain, still in the stance of his finishing blow, looked up at Kaien. Neither had the strength to move anymore. Kaien struggled to speak. “You... are the Kingdom’s Greatest Sword.” “…” The two men exchanged smiles. Having reached the peak of their abilities, they poured every ounce of their strength into this battle, leaving not a single regret behind. And so, in this moment, they alone were able to smile. Kaien turned his body, facing the Delphine forces. With the last bit of strength he could muster, he shouted. “Everyone, surrender!” Thud. With those words, Kaien collapsed to his knees as though his body had crumbled. Slowly, his eyes closed, and his head drooped. The legend of Kaien Balzac, the Kingdom’s Greatest Sword, ended here. And with it, a new Kingdom’s Greatest Sword was born. The Fenris forces, mercenaries, and even Count Mowbray’s soldiers all raised their weapons and erupted into cheers. “Waaahhhhh!” “The Commander has won!” “Our lord is now the Kingdom’s Greatest Sword!” “Hahaha... What? What? What?” Their cheers turned into gasps of shock as Ghislain’s body suddenly swayed and fell sideways. Thud! “Save the lord!” The Fenris knights rushed to Ghislain in a panic. Thankfully, they all carried healing potions with them. They drenched Ghislain in potions as though trying to bathe him, but even so, he remained unconscious. Count Mowbray, the highest-ranking noble present, turned to the Delphine forces and asked. “Will you fight?” The commanders of the Delphine army gazed at Kaien’s kneeling corpse. Tears streamed down their faces, filled with grief and bitterness, but one by one, they laid down their weapons. It was the only way to honor the man they most revered as the Kingdom’s Greatest Sword. Having disarmed the Delphine forces, Count Mowbray turned to Dominic and gave an order. “Surround the city. Let no retainers of the Duke escape.” “Understood.” They couldn’t abandon their Supreme Commander and enter the city yet. They needed to wait until he regained consciousness. But Count Mowbray thought surrounding the city was likely futile. He’s probably already fled. News of their arrival must have reached the Duke’s ears by now. Regardless of who won the duel between Ghislain and Kaien, the Duke would not have stayed to see the outcome. A full day passed before Ghislain finally woke up. “Ugh... I slept too long.” Dominic exclaimed with joy. “You’re awake! Your injuries are severe, so please don’t move recklessly!” “Is the city surrounded?” “Yes, not even an ant can slip through.” “Hmm... Let’s go inside.” Supported by knights, Ghislain rose to his feet. Moving was still difficult, but there was little to worry about. They had a force of 80,000 here. Until the southern armies arrived, nothing significant would happen. Ghislain slowly entered the city. The streets were deserted. Everyone was likely hiding in their homes. He passed through the silent streets and arrived at the imposing white castle. “Finally, I’ve come to this place.” He had been here in his previous life as well. After seizing the capital, he had come to this castle in search of the Duke, only to find it empty. “Will he be gone this time as well?” Ghislain had the same thought as Count Mowbray. With the battle’s outcome determined, there was no reason for the Duke to wait here idly. In his past life, the Duke had fled multiple times, leaving Ghislain unable to even catch a glimpse of him. The castle was just as quiet as the streets. It seemed the servants had already fled. Still, the Duke’s retainers would be hiding throughout the city. There was no way all of them had escaped. Supported by knights, Ghislain struggled forward. Eventually, he reached the heart of the castle, the Hall of Glory. “Huh?” In the center of the vast hall stood about a dozen figures, lined up as if blocking the way. They were the Duke’s last line of defense: the assassins under Melkir’s command. Before them lay a single corpse. Ghislain immediately recognized who it was. “Raul.” The fleeing Raul had died here. His body was riddled with dozens of daggers, surrounded by a pool of blood. It was clear that the assassins standing before him were responsible. Behind them, at the highest position in the hall, stood a man with his hands clasped behind his back. He was gazing at a painting hanging on the wall. The painting, drenched in crimson, depicted a monstrous beast trampling and devouring people. It resembled a dragon, but it wasn’t. Its appearance was closer to that of a snake. The man, still admiring the painting, slowly turned his head to look at Ghislain. “Are you the Count of Fenris?” “You are...?” The man smiled gently and spoke. “This is our first meeting. I am Ernheart Delphine, the master of this castle.” Ernheart had been waiting for Ghislain.
