On the vast plains, two armies faced each other. One bore the banners of the Northern Army, while the other flew the flags of the Delfine Dukedom. Count Mathes, commanding the Delfine army’s second division, turned to the figure beside him. “Are you certain that the Count of Fenris isn’t present?” “Yes. If he cared for his father and sister, he would have acted by now.” The one answering was Dentaria, a high-ranking inquisitor of the Salvation Order. A former priest who had incited barbarians to create chaos in the north, Dentaria had since joined the Delfine forces. Count Mathes nodded thoughtfully. “Even without the Count of Fenris, the Northern Army is elite. Their soldiers are strong, and their equipment is renowned. Your priests will need to play a crucial role.” While the soldiers and knights of the two armies were relatively even in skill, the Northern Army had the advantage in equipment and war machines. Known for their mobility despite carrying siege weapons, the Northern Army utilized innovative technology developed by the Count of Fenris himself. The Delfine forces, in contrast, had forgone siege weapons to maintain speed, planning to rely on supply units to bring reinforcements once the path was clear. However, the Northern Army was sure to have an array of trebuchets at the ready. “We need to break through as quickly as possible. We can’t afford a drawn-out artillery duel,” Count Mathes declared. The Northern Army, meanwhile, only needed to delay the Delfine forces. There was no reason for them to engage unless absolutely necessary. If the Northern Army had been smaller, it might have been feasible to simply overwhelm them with superior numbers. But with 80,000 soldiers, the Northern Army was formidable enough to deter any reckless advances. Dentaria offered a reassuring smile. “The Northern Army will be weaker without the Count of Fenris. As long as we neutralize their seventh-circle mage, our priests can lead the charge to destroy their trebuchets. While there will be casualties, it’s nothing to worry about.” “Very well.” Count Mathes had no choice but to trust the Salvation Order’s superhumans. With the Northern Army entrenched behind their siege weapons, this was essentially a fortress assault without walls. To breach their lines, the Salvation Order’s superhumans would have to disrupt the Northern Army’s formation. _“With the Count of Fenris absent, it’s achievable.”_ Count Mathes firmly believed this. After all, they had three high-ranking priests among their ranks. If the Northern Army could be annihilated, the Count of Fenris would lose his foundation, tipping the war decisively in their favor. While allied reinforcements were trickling in, they weren’t yet a significant threat. If the capital fell, everything else could be dealt with systematically. To Count Mathes, the idea of losing was inconceivable. His only concerns were minimizing casualties and executing the additional orders given to him. “In this battle, we’ve been instructed to eliminate Alfoy if possible.” “The hidden seventh-circle mage?” “Exactly. Once we break through their lines, prioritize killing him. Make sure he doesn’t retreat to join the Count of Fenris.” “Understood. I’ve studied his portrait. As soon as we destroy their siege weapons, I’ll hunt him down.” Dentaria grinned cruelly. The Count of Fenris had been a thorn in the Delfine Dukedom’s side for too long, largely due to the many unpredictable variables he controlled. Alfoy, who had been hiding his true abilities, was one such variable. The Delfine Dukedom’s plan was to systematically eliminate these variables and restore control over the battlefield. Watching Dentaria’s grin, Count Mathes sighed bitterly. _“There’s no turning back now.”_ The southern vassals of the Delfine Dukedom had no choice but to follow their liege. They had long understood the Duke’s merciless nature. If any of them defected, the Delfine Dukedom would retaliate with brutal swiftness. Many vassals had their families held hostage by the Duke—an age-old tradition, but one taken to an extreme under Raul’s leadership. Even the lords who didn’t care for their families had been forced into compliance, valuing their own lives too much to resist. _“We have no choice. The only way to survive is to take the kingdom.”_ Victory in the civil war was now their only path forward. They were bound to the Salvation Order, for better or worse. The soldiers’ morale was low, a mix of fear and disillusionment with the unjust cause they were fighting for. Still, the Delfine forces were well-trained and disciplined, and Count Mathes could only rely on that. “Advance!” Count Mathes commanded. The Delfine forces began to move, and the Northern Army, already prepared, readied themselves for battle. Claude, standing confidently among the Northern Army’s command, spoke with ease. “If they fight us head-on, we’ll win. They don’t have any artillery. There’s nothing to worry about—they’ll just walk straight into our range and get blown apart.” Behind the Northern Army, hundreds of trebuchets were already positioned. With such firepower, any enemy that entered their range would be obliterated. Ghislain had used similar tactics when fighting Marquis Rodrick. Properly deployed, trebuchets were devastating on open battlefields. Even so, Tenant, who had previously faced the Fenris Army, voiced a concern. “They must know about our trebuchets. If they’re advancing anyway, they must have a plan. It’s possible they’ve brought superhumans with them.” Logically, the likelihood of superhumans among the Delfine forces was slim—they were exceedingly rare. But after capturing Lavier, it was clear the Salvation Order had hidden superhumans. It couldn’t be ruled out. “If they have superhumans, they’ll target our trebuchets first,” Tenant continued. “While we can defend against them, there will undoubtedly be casualties.” Claude nodded, acknowledging the risk. “Then we’ll need to counteract that. Chief Ereneth, we’ll need you to step up!” Ereneth, the elven High Chief, replied calmly. “What would you have me do?” “You’ll lead the charge! Head out first and stop their advance!” “...Alone?” “Yes, by yourself!” “No matter how strong I am, I can’t face an army of 100,000 alone.” Even for a superhuman like Ereneth, such a feat was impossible. She would exhaust herself before even scratching the surface of the enemy forces. The Delfine Dukedom’s army was filled with skilled knights and mages, and it was certain they had superhumans as well. Ereneth’s hesitation was clear, but Claude, his tone suddenly solemn, declared: “Chief Ereneth! With great power comes great responsibility! You must act to minimize our losses!” To Ereneth, it sounded like an order to go out, kill as many as possible, and die a glorious death. For once, the usually composed Ereneth couldn’t suppress her irritation. “And what about you? You’re pushing the responsibility onto me—what exactly do you plan to do?” Claude puffed out his chest proudly. “I don’t have great power, so I bear no responsibility.” “...” A tense silence hung in the command post. Even Kaor, infamous for his brutish demeanor, and Alfoy, no stranger to mischief, were wearing expressions of disdain. Wendy quickly clamped her hand over Claude’s mouth and bowed apologetically. “I’m sorry about him. He’s usually like this, but today... he’s worse.” Claude struggled free from her grip and shouted, “No, listen to me! We need Chief Ereneth to step up before the enemy picks up speed and charges!” Seeing the skepticism on everyone’s faces, Claude cautiously began to elaborate on his plan. “Here’s the idea. Chief Ereneth goes out—not as a superhuman, but disguised as a top-tier knight…” His explanation continued, and while it wasn’t entirely convincing, it carried a certain logic that made it difficult to outright dismiss. Ereneth, after a moment’s consideration, nodded. She remembered Ghislain’s orders: in war, trust Claude’s judgment. She decided to give him this chance. “Fine. I’ll do it. But if things don’t go as you say, I won’t follow your orders again.” “You won’t regret this, Chief. And if I’m wrong, I’ll resign on the spot.” Unbeknownst to Ereneth, Claude’s dream was to one day resign and live a peaceful life. Meanwhile, the Delfine army began accelerating, aiming to charge the Northern Army as soon as they entered the trebuchets’ range. This strategy relied heavily on the three superhumans leading their vanguard. With their power, the Delfine army believed they could scatter the Northern forces and dismantle their artillery. Count Mathes raised a hand and called to his officers. “The vanguard is nearing the trebuchets’ range. Push forward as quickly as possible. We must penetrate their formation.” Despite their massive numbers—100,000 strong—the Delfine army was prepared to suffer significant losses in the middle and rear lines from the trebuchet barrage. The plan was for the vanguard, led by the superhumans, to destroy the Northern Army’s siege weapons and pave the way for the rest of their forces to overwhelm the defenders. “Prepare the mages! Block their seventh-circle mage’s spells!” The Delfine mages began gathering their mana. They had five sixth-circle mages on the battlefield, in addition to a larger contingent of fifth- and fourth-circle mages. With this concentration of magical power, they felt confident in countering any spell the Northern Army could unleash. As the Delfine army drew closer, their speed increasing with every step, an unexpected figure emerged from the Northern ranks. “Hmm? What’s that?” A lone elf dashed forward, planting herself squarely in the path of the advancing Delfine army. The elf radiated an intense aura. Count Mathes narrowed his eyes at the sight. “It’s clear what they’re trying to do.” He signaled for the army to slow their advance and turned to Dentaria for counsel. “It looks like they’re calling for a duel. What do you think?” “Judging by her aura, she’s a top-tier knight. This is an excellent opportunity to eliminate her before the battle begins.” “I agree. With the Count of Fenris absent, they’re resorting to desperate measures.” “They likely don’t realize we have three superhumans. Let’s make them pay for their ignorance.” No one could have guessed that a single army would field three superhumans. To eliminate the Northern Army entirely, both the Delfine Dukedom and the Salvation Order had made significant sacrifices. While the Northern Army was known for its exceptional warriors, it seemed they were gambling on this duel to bolster their morale. If the Delfine army won the duel, their own morale would soar, and the Northern Army’s advantage would be significantly reduced. “Gillian, Kaor, Vanessa... they’re all on our target list,” Dentaria mused. “But this elf... she wasn’t in the reports. It can’t be that foul-mouthed elf, can it?” After a moment’s thought, Dentaria continued. “No matter. Judging by her aura, she’s comparable to them. Eliminating her here can only benefit us.” “Agreed. Killing someone of her caliber will reduce our casualties once the armies clash.” “I’ll take care of her personally. As soon as she’s dead, order the charge. I’ll join you immediately afterward.” “Very well.” Count Mathes deliberately slowed the army’s advance. As the vanguard neared the trebuchets’ range, they halted, waiting for the elf’s response. The expected trebuchet fire didn’t come. “Of course, they’re calling for a duel. Perfect. Once it’s over, we’ll strike immediately.” Though the elf seemed formidable, Dentaria was confident. No matter how strong she might be, she wouldn’t be a match for him. After all, if she were that powerful, her reputation would have already spread. Dentaria strode forward confidently, stopping before Ereneth. “What’s your name? You’re not in any of our records.” “Ereneth.” “Ereneth, huh? Never heard of you. You’re not Lumina or Ascon, that much is clear.” Ereneth didn’t answer. Instead, she asked a question of her own. “Why did you stop your army?” “Isn’t it obvious? You’re calling for a duel, aren’t you?” “That’s true. But why accept? Why not charge forward and fight? If you lose, your situation will worsen.” “Hah! Lose? Me? You foolish elf, do you have any idea who I am?” “So, you stepped forward expecting to win.” “Of course. With the Count of Fenris gone, the Northern Army has no superhumans left. No one can stand against me.” A dark, ominous aura began to emanate from Dentaria, creeping toward Ereneth and pressing heavily upon her. Grinning maliciously, he declared, “You’re right. The trebuchets put us at a disadvantage. But this duel gives us the perfect excuse to neutralize someone like you. Once you’re dead, our casualties will be significantly reduced.” “Interesting.” “What’s so interesting?” “That you’re moving exactly as that lighthearted man said you would.” The ground beneath Ereneth began to tremble. Vines sprouted, winding their way up her body, forming a suit of armor made entirely of wood. Antler-like protrusions emerged from her head, and a soft green aura enveloped her, pulsating with life. Seeing this transformation, Dentaria’s expression hardened. “You... you’ve been hiding your power.” The aura emanating from Ereneth was no longer that of a top-tier knight. It was unmistakably that of a superhuman. Stepping forward, Ereneth spoke calmly. “You should’ve used your entire army to crush me. If you had, I might have retreated.” “What?” “In truth, we planned to start this battle by eliminating one of your superhumans.” A sharp, vibrant green light flared from Ereneth’s eyes, illuminating the battlefield.
