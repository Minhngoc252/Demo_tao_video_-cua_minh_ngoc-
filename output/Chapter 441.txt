“Go check for traps,” Woroca commanded, wary of falling into the same kind of ambush as before. At his order, a hundred barbarian warriors rode toward the Rayfold army’s formation, their horses galloping heavily. **Thud, thud, thud, thud!** The warriors approached the Rayfold army and inspected the surrounding area, including the edge of the distant shrubland just in case. The Rayfold forces made no response. They didn’t loose arrows or cast spells. It was as if they were deliberately allowing the inspection, exuding an air of confidence that grated on Woroca’s nerves. “Arrogant bastards… Let’s see how long they can keep acting so smug.” Once again, the Rayfold forces had placed their heavy infantry at the front, with cavalry positioned at the rear as before. The formation was simple: a long, rectangular line that seemed built solely to endure. It was painfully obvious they intended to hold their ground and wear the barbarians out. “No one can fight endlessly. If we can’t break through that line, we’ll be stuck here for days again.” Meanwhile, dissatisfaction among the other tribal leaders was reaching a boiling point. Woroca’s leadership and competence were being questioned more openly. “This time, I’ll crush them,” Woroca growled, determined to avoid another humiliating defeat. With the absence of traps confirmed, he prepared to strike. Barbarian cavalry were somewhat limited in their tactical options, relying heavily on their powerful charge. However, Rayfold’s heavy infantry had proven difficult to break even with cavalry. “Both sides are blocked by the forest and river, so we can’t flank them. We’ll have to grind them down.” One tribal leader approached Woroca and asked, “Are you sure they won’t lure us into another trap?” “It’s impossible here with their numbers. We can deploy far more troops. Their superior equipment means they’ll hold out for a while, but in the end, they’ll tire faster than us.” “Fine. This time, let’s crush them cleanly.” “Keep the formation tight and hit their line all at once.” A wedge-shaped charge was the most effective cavalry tactic, but against Rayfold’s heavy infantry, a broad assault seemed the safer option. Hitting multiple points simultaneously would also reduce the risk of falling prey to the enemy’s tactics. “Go! Kill every single one of them this time!” **Hoooooonk!** The blaring war horn signaled the charge as the first wave of barbarian warriors surged forward. **Thud, thud, thud, thud!** This time, their ferocity and determination were sharper than ever. The memory of their previous defeat still burned in their minds. “Waaaahhh! Our ancestors watch over us!” The vanguard, made up of elite warriors, roared as they charged, their voices echoing across the battlefield. Woroca had placed his strongest warriors at the forefront, aiming to quickly breach Rayfold’s defenses and prevent them from enacting another strategy. The barbarians accelerated, their war cries filling the air. At last, Rayfold’s army began to respond. **Fwoosh!** Arrows and spells rained down, this time scattered across the charging barbarians instead of focusing solely on the center. **Hummm…** A dark aura surrounded the barbarian warriors, shielding them from the incoming projectiles. The priests of the Cult of Salvation were pouring their strength into protecting the warriors, knowing this battle needed to be decided swiftly. Rayfold’s attacks barely caused any damage. The barbarian warriors collided with the Rayfold line. **BOOOM!** The front ranks of Rayfold’s formation shook, with some soldiers forced backward. Although many barbarians were thrown from their mounts by spears emerging through the shield wall, the damage was less than the number of successful attackers. “Die!” **Clang! Clang! Clang!** The vanguard warriors swung massive axes, smashing against the shields of the Rayfold soldiers. The elevated position of mounted warriors gave them a clear advantage, allowing them to rain powerful blows onto the defenders below. The Rayfold soldiers held their shields tightly and focused on disabling the horses instead of fighting back. **Slash! Slash!** **Neigh!** Screams erupted as horses had their legs slashed and collapsed, throwing their riders to the ground. However, the barbarians had anticipated this. Landing deftly, they immediately resumed their assault with axes. The ferocity of the vanguard created gaps in the Rayfold formation. Seeing this, Woroca issued another command. “Second wave, advance!” **Thud, thud, thud, thud!** The next line of barbarian warriors charged forward, aiming to exploit the gaps and overwhelm the defenders. **BOOOM!** Once more, the Rayfold formation was struck by a relentless wave of cavalry, scattering parts of their line. Warriors trampled over allies and enemies alike, causing chaos within the ranks. “Third wave! Dismount and engage!” Woroca ordered the next group to abandon their mounts and engage in close combat. The battlefield was now too congested for further cavalry charges to be effective. **Thud, thud, thud!** The third wave charged on foot, screaming as they advanced. “WAAAAHHH!” Pushing, shoving, and hacking their way forward, they pressed deeper into the Rayfold formation. Though the barbarians suffered significant losses, the effectiveness of their assault was undeniable. The first rank of Rayfold’s line was on the verge of collapse. At that moment, Amelia’s calm voice cut through the din of battle. “Fall back.” **Thud!** The Rayfold soldiers in the disrupted front lines began to retreat, creating more space for the barbarians to advance. “It’s working! Keep pushing!” Woroca shouted with elation. With 30,000 warriors committed to the assault, even the most fortified line would eventually crumble under their sheer numbers. However, Amelia’s sharp eyes caught sight of something in the distance. Above her, Dark flew in circles, signaling. Her gaze shifted forward, narrowing as she raised her hand slowly. **Hoooooonk!** A horn sounded, and flags waved from the rear of the Rayfold formation. “What now?” Woroca muttered, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the sound of hooves reached his ears. **Thud, thud, thud!** Woroca turned his head, unease creeping into his expression. The sound was coming from the shrubland—the area they had scouted and cleared earlier. Suddenly, from the depths of the shrubland, a force of cavalry emerged. “What the—!” The newly arrived cavalry bore the crest of Rayfold, and they were entirely mounted. “They were hiding troops?!” Woroca exclaimed, realization dawning too late. The Rayfold cavalry, emerging in a wedge formation, charged toward the flanks of the barbarian army, where they would strike the most vulnerable points. Still, Woroca wasn’t entirely disheartened. “This could be an opportunity,” he muttered. He still had 20,000 warriors in reserve. If he could counter this new force effectively, it would crush the Rayfold army’s morale. “Attack them! Crush their reinforcements and secure our victory!” As Woroca prepared to issue the order, a new sound shook the ground beneath him. **Thud, thud, thud!** This time, the sound came from behind his own army. “What’s that?” The barbarian warriors, on the verge of charging, froze. Woroca turned his head slowly. When he saw the source of the noise, his blood ran cold. Riding a black horse cloaked in crimson smoke was a man with a ferocious grin. **Thud, thud, thud!** As the smoke billowed, the horse’s speed only increased, leaving the army following it far behind. The lone rider seemed to charge straight into the battlefield alone. But Woroca knew better than to dismiss this figure. He knew all too well who it was. “The Blood Demon…” he whispered, terror lacing his voice. **Ghislain Ferdium** —that bastard had managed to seal the massive rift and still arrived here with an army in tow. To think he stopped a rift of that magnitude and still came marching with such force. It was incomprehensible. Unbelievable. “I… I…” Woroca couldn’t find the words. His thoughts were a chaotic mess, his mind overwhelmed. Why had he thought he could fight that man? No answer came. His head spun with confusion and dread. “Chief!” A deafening shout from his side jolted him back to reality. The battle-hardened warrior, Monga, roared to snap him out of his daze. Woroca shook his head violently, casting off his thoughts. He couldn’t afford to falter now. “Stop him! All of you, stop that man first!” He pointed at Ghislain, his voice breaking into a desperate bellow. The situation was dire. Their forces were surrounded: the **Rayfold****Army** in front, a river to their left, and now Ghislain behind them. The only solace was their sheer numerical advantage, and the fact that his warriors were not ones to cower. “Let’s goooooo!” The barbarian warriors raised their weapons high and let out a feral battle cry. **Thud-thud-thud-thud!** The soldiers who had been preparing to flank the Rayfold Army turned their horses and charged toward Ghislain. They gritted their teeth at the sight of him. “There he is again! Coming alone!” “This time, we’re taking him down for good!” “With the blessings of our ancestors, we’ll crush him!” Two thousand savage warriors charged forward, their battle cries filling the air with menace. Ghislain, watching their approach, allowed a grin to creep across his face. **Whoosh!** Dark crimson smoke enveloped his body, merging him with his steed, **Black King**. The Black King surged forward, a streak of shadows darting toward the incoming horde. **BOOM!** The collision was like an earthquake. The barbarian warriors at the forefront exploded into pieces, their bodies unable to withstand the sheer force. **Slash! Slash! Slash!** Ghislain tore through the line, cleaving half the formation before coming to a halt. The power was staggering. The warriors hesitated, momentarily frozen by the display of absolute destruction. This was the devastation a **Master** could unleash—capable of cutting down thousands on his own. “Swarm him! Take him down together! He must die first!” Woroca’s desperate cries rekindled the warriors’ resolve. With guttural roars, they surged toward Ghislain. “Kill him!” Ghislain leaned forward, patting the Black King’s neck as he spoke softly. “Go wild. Show them no mercy.” **Neighhh!** The Black King let out a shrill cry and began rampaging through the ranks. **Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!** Each kick from the Black King sent bodies flying, warriors bursting like overripe fruit. Encased in Ghislain’s dark energy, the steed wasn’t just a horse—it was a calamity on par with the most fearsome of monsters. “What the hell is this beast?!” Even hardened barbarians, accustomed to fighting monstrous creatures, recoiled in terror. But it wasn’t just the Black King wreaking havoc. Ghislain, perched atop his mount, wielded his spear with relentless precision. **Slash! Slash! Slash!** Heads rolled and blood sprayed before anyone could get close. Normally, even a Master would be hard-pressed to face 20,000 warriors alone. Their stamina wasn’t infinite. But Ghislain wasn’t conserving his strength—he didn’t need to. “You’re the ones who are surrounded.” He spoke with a mocking grin. And then it happened. **BOOM!** The **Fenris** and **Ferdium** knights, along with their cavalry, crashed into the barbarians’ flanks. “Arghhhh!” Caught between the hammer of the knights and the anvil of Ghislain, the barbarian ranks crumbled. From the wooded area, the Rayfold cavalry emerged, slamming into the barbarian soldiers already tangled in battle with the Rayfold infantry. **BOOM!** The barbarians, who had been doggedly pushing forward, now found themselves with no escape. Trapped, they were crushed and slaughtered. “Stop them! Kill those bastards first!” Though still numerically superior, the barbarians were in disarray. Many turned to face the cavalry, desperate to counter the charge. And then, from her elevated position, **Amelia** rose from her seat. She extended her hand, her voice cold and commanding. “Advance. Crush them all.” **Thud!** The Rayfold Army, which had been slowly retreating, suddenly stopped. With a synchronized motion, they began to push forward, shields locking and spears thrusting. **Thud!** The unexpected advance sent the barbarians staggering backward. Amelia’s icy gaze swept across the battlefield as she uttered her final command. “Leave no one alive.” It was a perfect encirclement, a flawless trap that gave the barbarians no way out. The end of the battle was drawing near, and so too was the annihilation of Woroca and his horde.
