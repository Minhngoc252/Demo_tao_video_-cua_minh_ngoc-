Halfway through the search, Claude had nearly given up. Finding a single refugee in the midst of a chaotic war was an almost impossible task. The only advantage was that it was relatively easier to track refugees crossing borders, and luck was on their side, thanks to the Byron officials’ diligence. Finally, Anna had been found. “Shall we go see her now?” an official asked. Claude nodded vigorously. “Yes, let’s go. Right now. Wait—hold on. Let me disguise myself.” Claude donned a simple disguise and cautiously made his way to the refugee camp. Having visited numerous camps while leading the Ruthanian army, he had seen how dire the conditions were. Food was scarce, sanitation was non-existent, and lawlessness often led to violence. Disease ran rampant, and the refugees’ survival was always in jeopardy. The kingdoms, overwhelmed by the Rifts and rebel forces, had no capacity to provide adequate aid. But the Byron camp was different. “This place is…” Claude and Wendy couldn’t hide their surprise as they looked around the camp. Abundant food, clean clothing, and medicine were being distributed. Soldiers patrolled to maintain order and prevent fights from breaking out. The refugees, used to harsh conditions, looked confused, as though unsure whether this generosity was real. Unbeknownst to them, these arrangements were made by Byron officials eager to gain Claude’s favor. The official accompanying Claude smiled subtly. “As you instructed, we’ve said nothing about your involvement. We’ve also taken every precaution to ensure there are no issues.” “…Thank you. I won’t forget your kindness.” The official beamed with satisfaction. Helping a savior of their kingdom felt like a meaningful contribution, and it didn’t hurt that their actions would strengthen ties with Ruthania. Claude’s gaze fell on a corner of the camp. There she was. Anna sat among a group of refugees, resting. She looked haggard and frail, the hardships she endured clearly etched on her face. Yet, the gentle smile on her face remained unchanged—a testament to her unyielding spirit, even in the face of adversity. She had always tried to smile, no matter how hard things got. “Anna…” Claude’s throat tightened as he muttered her name. She didn’t deserve this life. Born into a distinguished family, she had every reason to lead a comfortable and dignified existence. But her life had been shattered because of him. Since that moment, she had known no peace, no comfort. The guilt of ruining her life was a burden Claude could never shake. Even when he enslaved Alfoy, he hadn’t felt this level of remorse. Anna was his deepest regret. “…At least she’s safe.” Claude noticed how others in the camp were looking after Anna. Judging by their attire, they appeared to be her former colleagues from the academy she had been assigned to. It was thanks to them that she had survived this chaotic era unscathed. Now, it was time to bring closure to this long chapter of guilt and regret. Claude had avenged his mentor to make this moment possible. Claude turned to the Byron official who had accompanied him. “Assign some of our soldiers to escort the refugees from Сeyron back to their homeland safely.” “Yes, sir.” “Make sure they have enough food and secure housing so they can return to their daily lives without worry.” Сeyron had fallen under Ruthanian influence and would soon be fully annexed. It was far safer now than Byron, and Claude planned to station troops there temporarily to protect the returning refugees. This was the least he could do to ensure their peaceful resettlement. “They’ll hear that I avenged my mentor,” Claude murmured. As Сeyron’s acting governor, his name was sure to reach Anna’s ears. But by then, he would be long gone. “She’ll probably come looking for me,” he continued, “but I won’t be there to meet her.” “This will have to be enough.” His guilt over ruining her life wouldn’t disappear, but there was little else he could do for her now. The soldiers began informing the refugees of their new arrangements. The Сeyron refugees were ecstatic. “We’re finally going home?” “They’ll even give us food and houses?” “Ruthania is really helping us!” Anna, too, clasped her hands together in joy. She had been unsure how much longer she would have to wander, but now she could return home, with food and shelter promised. Then, as if sensing something, Anna turned her head. Amid the cheering crowd, she noticed someone staring at her. “Who…?” The face was unfamiliar, yet it felt strangely familiar. The man looked at her for a moment longer before turning away. Almost instinctively, Anna muttered, “…Claude?” But she quickly shook her head. She knew Claude had followed Grand Duke Fenris. She had also heard that Fenris’s army was now aiding this kingdom. Yet the Claude she remembered was timid, cowardly, and all talk—hardly someone suited for the battlefield. ‘He always said safety came first,’ she thought. He was probably working as an administrator in Fenris’s territory. There was no way he could be here. Smiling at her own musings, Anna turned back to the others, joining them in their celebration. As Claude walked away from the camp, Wendy spoke hesitantly. “Are you sure? You’re not going to meet her?” “There’s no point. What good would it do?” “But… you worked so hard to find her.” Claude sighed. “That was just for my own peace of mind. She lost her father because of me and had to live such a hard life.” “…I see.” Wendy didn’t press further. She could sense the weight of Claude’s guilt. For someone who seemed shameless in his daily dealings, Claude clearly carried more regret than she had realized. Feeling slightly lighter, Claude joked, “Besides, a successful ex showing up out of nowhere is only fitting in revenge stories. I’m the one who ended it, you know. What kind of nerve would it take to show up in front of her now?” Wendy smirked at his words. Successful ex? This man? His official title was still “slave.” Noticing her expression, Claude cleared his throat awkwardly. “Ahem, anyway. I’ve done what I can.” Anna would no longer want for anything. Сeyron’s administrators would continue to support her discreetly, ensuring her safety and well-being. That was enough for Claude. Now, only one task remained: to destroy the Salvation Order and ensure a safe future for everyone. As for exacting revenge on the Revolutionary Corps for framing his mentor, that would come in due time. With a slightly lighter heart, Claude prepared to leave Byron. He walked ahead with his usual spring in his step, while Wendy quietly followed behind. *** The Rutania forces, after completing their regrouping and resupply, began their march toward the neighboring kingdom. During the journey, Ghislain received letters from Julien, detailing the progress of his campaign and their mutual goal to rendezvous in Sardina. The letters also served to coordinate strategies and share updates on the battlefield. Thanks to Dark’s assistance, the armies were able to exchange messages with unprecedented speed. Bellinda, standing beside Ghislain, wore a mixed expression of doubt and anticipation. “Do you really think they’ll make it here safely? The Salvation Order isn’t exactly a pushover, and they have to subdue rebellions in two kingdoms before they even get here.” “There’s nothing to worry about. That guy’s insanely strong. Handling that much should be no problem for him, especially since the Salvation Order doesn’t have their main forces there anymore.” “How are you so sure he’s strong? He’s just appeared on the scene, and the rumors about his exploits sound exaggerated at best.” “I know everything.” “…” Like Claude, Bellinda found herself at a loss for words. Ghislain’s uncanny ability to predict outcomes was so consistent that it almost felt supernatural. “Well then, shall we check on Elena’s training today?” Not wanting her talents to go to waste, Ghislain had brought Elena and Rachel along, ensuring they received intensive mana training during their journey. Whenever there was downtime between marches, he made them practice an accelerated mana cultivation technique. Since learning the method, the two had occasionally joined the battles against Rift creatures, contributing to the fight. The moment Ghislain approached, both Elena and Rachel visibly paled. The mana cultivation technique was undeniably effective, but its side effect was the intense pain that came with it. Elena, with a dead-eyed expression, pleaded, “Can we please stop with this torture already?” “No.” “Then how about a break today?” “No…” Before he could finish, Elena’s fist lashed out, slicing through the air with a sharp crack. She intended to catch Ghislain off guard and knock him unconscious. “Oh, so that’s how we’re playing?” Ghislain dodged effortlessly, closed the distance, and wrapped an arm around her neck. At the same time, his hand pressed against her back, infusing her with a surge of mana. “Arghhhh! Aghhhhh!” Unable to withstand the pain, Elena retaliated with a clean elbow strike to his side. **Crack!** The blow sent searing pain through Ghislain’s ribs, and he gritted his teeth in response. It felt as if one of his ribs had cracked—or worse. “Damn it! You little monster!” “Sh-shut up! Don’t call me that! Aghhhhhh!” **Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!** Elena flailed in agony, repeatedly slamming her elbow into Ghislain’s torso. Her natural divine strength had been growing rapidly, and with the cultivation technique, her power was increasing exponentially. **Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!** As Ghislain endured the assault, a thought crossed his mind: _“This is ridiculous. She’s really going to end up as one of the continent’s Eight Strongest at this rate. God, this hurts.”_ The only reason he could withstand her attacks was his abnormal resilience and regenerative ability. Any ordinary knight would have been incapacitated after the first strike. In comparison, Rachel was much easier to handle. When she hit her limit, she simply fainted. But Elena was different—a relentless force who refused to go down, no matter what. When the forced mana cultivation session finally ended, Ghislain quickly backed away, clutching his side. “You’re on your own now. That should be enough training for today. I’m done. Damn monster princess.” “Ugh…” Collapsed on the ground, Elena shot Ghislain a fiery glare. It was utterly unfair, she thought, that she had to endure such torment. Other noble ladies were living comfortably in the capital, yet here she was, slogging through the battlefield. _“This is what they call the duty of nobility? Ugh, it’s not wrong, but it still sucks.”_ Elena directed all her pent-up frustration at the Rift creatures. **Boom!** Slamming the "Hammer of Destruction" into the ground, she stood at the forefront of the battlefield. Until now, Elena and Rachel had mostly stayed behind the knights, gradually gaining combat experience. But today was different. Ghislain had decided it was time for them to fight at the vanguard. **Kreeeeaaaah!** A swarm of Rift creatures rushed toward them, but Elena showed no fear. Instead, her gaze burned with unbridled fury. _“I need something to take this stress out on.”_ “Raaaaahhhh!” With a deafening roar, she swung her massive hammer. **BOOM!** **Kreeeeek?!** The creatures in her path were obliterated in a single blow.
