Ghislain noticed Marquis Gideon’s suspicious glance and quickly spoke up. “If you’re going to loaf around anyway, why not do it in my territory? Once we get any intel, we can immediately move to capture those bastards.” “Hmm…” “Parniel agreed too. The Salvation Order is gone now, isn’t it? Instead of wandering aimlessly, it’s more effective to rely on our information network.” “That’s a reasonable point.” “Exactly. Besides, most of the people we know are already planning to come to my territory. It’d be nice if you joined us and spent some time together.” Julien seemed to be considering Ghislain’s proposal, but Marquis Gideon wasn’t so easily convinced. He narrowed his eyes and asked pointedly: “Julien won’t be put through any hardship, will he?” The Ruthania Kingdom—and in particular, the Fenris territory—was notorious for being unusually busy and unpredictable. Marquis Gideon had seen firsthand how Ghislain managed affairs, and it was far from ordinary. While Ghislain’s results were always impressive, the process of getting there was chaotic and often grueling. Understanding Gideon’s concerns, Ghislain let out a small chuckle before answering: “Oh, he’ll just be relaxing, I assure you. There won’t be anything dangerous or stressful. We’ve dealt with all the immediate threats, haven’t we?” It wasn’t a lie. Ghislain was indeed planning to focus on developing the territory and uncovering past truths, which included a campaign to clear out the Monster Forest. However, in his mind, this was nothing more than a recreational camping trip with friends to enjoy nature and the outdoors. Given the current strength of Fenris’s forces, which were the most powerful in the kingdom’s history, this expedition posed no significant challenge. If Julien joined them, the Monster Forest would feel as harmless as a goblin-infested grove. To Ghislain, this truly qualified as relaxing. Marquis Gideon, unaware of Ghislain’s unusual standards for leisure, was swayed by the sincerity in his tone and nodded in agreement. “Julien, I think this might be a good idea. If you stay in Fenris for a while, I’ll handle stabilizing the kingdom back home.” Julien was already disliked by the king, and the process of securing rewards for the soldiers had only deepened the hostility between Julien and the nobles. Marquis Gideon hoped to keep those nobles from targeting Julien any further. Julien was beloved by the soldiers and widely admired by the people. The only thing saving the nobles from complete upheaval was Julien’s lack of interest in seizing power. “I’ll take care of everything,” Marquis Gideon resolved, determined to consolidate enough authority to protect Julien. He had more than enough capability to do so. In the meantime, Fenris seemed like the safest place for Julien to rest. Julien fell silent, pondering his options. “Which choice should I make?” His instincts urged him to seek Gatros, but Ghislain’s suggestion made him waver. The feeling that he needed to track Gatros was strong, but he wasn’t entirely sure it was the right call. Unable to fully trust his supernatural intuition, Julien deliberated for a long time before finally nodding. “Alright, I’ll rely on you for the time being.” When uncertain, Julien followed the principle he had adopted during the war: trust Ghislain’s judgment. He had resolved to believe in Ghislain’s decisions, and so far, that trust had never failed him. On a personal note, Julien also felt more at ease in Ruthania. Unlike in his own kingdom, he wasn’t treated as an outcast. In fact, some people in Ruthania—such as Alfoy and Claude—seemed to treat him with a baffling amount of comfort and familiarity. “Good choice. Let’s get along well,” Ghislain said with a wide grin. Julien wasting his strength on pointless endeavors would be a loss for the world. That strength needed to be directed toward proper causes. Ghislain was genuinely pleased that Julien agreed. In his previous life, he had often witnessed the Turian king provoking Julien or refusing to cooperate with anything related to him. If even Julien’s father acted that way, the nobles were no better. They schemed tirelessly to undermine Julien from behind the scenes. “It’s better for you to stay in my territory. At least there, you’ll be treated fairly,” Ghislain thought. This sentiment was genuine. A friend who had fought to protect the world deserved better than such mistreatment. With Julien accepting his offer, Marquis Gideon finally felt some relief. Julien staying in the Turian Kingdom amidst its current political storm would do no good for anyone. And so, Ghislain began the journey back to Ruthania with Julien in tow. *** The streets of the capital, Cardenia, were overflowing with people. Every corner of the streets, every window, and every rooftop was packed with citizens. The city seemed to come alive, with cheers rippling through the air like waves. “Our savior!” “Long live His Grace, the Duke!” “The Protector of Ruthania!” The deafening cheers combined into a thunderous roar. Children sat on their parents’ shoulders, waving their small hands eagerly, while elderly citizens wept and bowed deeply in gratitude. From windows and balconies, petals rained down endlessly. Red rose petals, white lily petals, and yellow marigold petals danced in the spring breeze, creating a vivid cascade of colors. “Hooray!” “Look this way, please!” “Oh, goddess, bless His Grace!” As Ghislain rode past on the Black King, the fervor of the crowd intensified. The celebratory banners fluttered in the wind, and the majestic music of marching bands filled the air. Flower bouquets thrown by the people piled up at the Black King’s feet. The continent had endured much—famine, the fissures, plagues, civil war, and a continent-spanning war. The wounds were deep and far from healed, but for today, it seemed the people could finally set their pain aside. Cardenia’s streets radiated with the joy of celebration. Genuine smiles adorned faces long marked by hardship, and the center of their gratitude was Ghislain. Thanks to him, the people found hope even in their darkest moments, and their perseverance had finally been rewarded with victory. “Hooray!” Amidst the cheers, an elderly woman cradled her grandson, smiling warmly. “Peace will come now…” It was a wish shared by all—a yearning for peace after the war’s end. The massive crowds filled the streets, imprinting this historic moment in their hearts. The moment where the war ended, and peace began. The procession stretched all the way to the royal palace. Upon arriving, Ghislain dismounted from his horse and walked forward, where someone awaited him. “Ghislain!” Zvalter approached with sparkling eyes, his voice trembling with emotion. Beside him stood Homern, Albert, Randolph, Fergus, and other figures from Ferdium. “My son, my son has finally returned.” Hearing the tremor in Zvalter’s voice, Ghislain smiled. Despite his position as king, Zvalter retained the simple demeanor he had in the north. “I’m back, Father.” “Yes, yes. You’ve done well. You’ve worked so hard. Come inside quickly.” Zvalter had worried endlessly as Ghislain fought tirelessly against the Salvation Order. As a father, he was both proud and perpetually anxious. When Elena returned home first, Zvalter had rushed out barefoot, weeping uncontrollably. Now, as he greeted his son, he tried to maintain his dignity. Seeing how much his father had aged, Ghislain chuckled softly. “Father, it looks like you’ve had a harder time than during the war.” “Don’t even start. Being king was a mistake. I feel like abandoning it all and returning to the countryside.” Zvalter shook his head with exasperation. For a responsible man, the throne brought endless burden rather than pleasure. He had been tirelessly working to restore the kingdom, devastated by successive disasters. His retainers were no different. Homern, Albert, and Randolph all looked haggard and drained as they spoke: “Can’t we just go back home?” “This is harder than when we were poor.” “I want to quit and go back to the fields!” These were the same people who once clamored for higher positions, now yearning to escape the relentless demands of managing an entire kingdom. But they had held on this long, thanks to the support of many. “Your Grace, we’re so relieved you’ve returned safely.” Mariel and Rosalyn greeted Ghislain with warm smiles. Ghislain returned their smiles and welcomed them in turn. Their expertise had played a critical role in stabilizing the kingdom. Mariel looked at Ghislain with a wistful smile. “It feels like just yesterday you were here selling cosmetics.” Those days were years ago now. The young noble from the outskirts had become the most influential man on the continent. Mariel had been one of the first to recognize Ghislain’s potential and had thrown her full support behind him. Thanks to her keen insight, the Aylesbury Countdom had risen to become one of the capital’s most prestigious families. After exchanging greetings, Mariel subtly nudged Rosalyn toward Ghislain. Seeing this, Ghislain turned to Rosalyn with another smile. “I’ve heard the kingdom stabilized quickly thanks to you both. I’m truly grateful.” “It’s what I’m supposed to do,” Rosalyn replied, blushing slightly—a rare reaction for her. But Ghislain, as oblivious as ever, immediately began asking about practical matters. “How’s the cosmetics trade progressing?” Rosalyn stiffened. She had been managing the cosmetics business entirely since Claude had little knowledge of it. Sales had plummeted during the war, leaving her frustrated. However, standing before the king and his ministers, she calmly replied: “Sales have been increasing since the fall of the Salvation Order. We’re considering trade with other kingdoms, so things should improve further.” “That’s excellent news!” Ghislain exclaimed with a bright smile. Finally, the cosmetics line could expand globally. It was all thanks to Rosalyn’s foresight and preparation. Ghislain continued to pepper her with questions about various projects: “What about the arrow delivery system and road construction?” “How are we budgeting for the soldiers’ equipment?” “What’s the status of medicinal production given the ongoing fissures?” As the conversation dragged on, Rosalyn’s expression grew increasingly blank. Ghislain was only asking about finances. The cold atmosphere prompted Zvalter to cough awkwardly. “Ahem, Ghislain. Let’s save the business discussions for later. For now, let’s rest and catch up. After dinner…” Zvalter, despite being king, still found Rosalyn—daughter of Marquis Branford—a bit intimidating. But Ghislain always prioritized what he deemed important. “Just a moment. This is critical, and I need a clear picture before…” Seeing no way to stop him, Mariel shrugged and stepped back, leaving Rosalyn to fend for herself. Eventually, Ghislain nodded in satisfaction, having received all the information he needed. “Good. I feel more reassured now. Anyway, about the kingdom’s finances…” At this point, Rosalyn snapped. She stopped walking abruptly and yelled: “Hey! Is money the only thing you can talk to me about? Every single time, it’s money this, money that! What now? Do you want me to bring the ledger? Are the accounts insufficient?!” “Thank you for handling it so well,” Ghislain replied calmly. A tense silence followed. Everyone stared at Rosalyn, who took a deep breath and bowed to Zvalter. “Your Majesty, forgive my outburst. I momentarily failed to control my emotions.” “Ah, no need to apologize. I understand the immense effort you’ve put in for the kingdom. My son is… well, he’s always been a bit strange.” After bowing once more, Rosalyn opened her fan with a dramatic flourish, covering her face. She shot Ghislain a glare before quickly excusing herself and fleeing the scene. This time, everyone turned their attention to Ghislain, who cleared his throat awkwardly. “I’ll apologize later… I suppose.” The others clicked their tongues. As always, Ghislain cared about little else besides battles and work. Zvalter shook his head. “Who would ever marry you? When are you planning to settle down?” With the war over, the topic of Ghislain’s marriage had resurfaced. As a key figure in the kingdom, his future lineage was now a matter of state concern. But Ghislain remained as uninterested as ever. He had too much work left to do. Anticipating more discussions about marriage, Ghislain quickly spoke up. “I’ll excuse myself for now.” “Where are you going? We haven’t even caught up yet.” “I’ll return for dinner. There’s someone I need to meet first.” “Who? Everyone will be here by dinner anyway.” “The High Elf Chieftain.” Ereneth had returned to Ruthania with Claude and was staying in seclusion, refusing all invitations and avoiding public appearances entirely. Even the royal festivities wouldn’t bring her out, so Ghislain decided to visit her himself. “Arterion was clearly not in its right mind,” Ghislain thought. He needed to ask her more about what had happened in the past—why the dragon had been so maddened—and whether she knew anything about the strange energy now residing in Julien.
