In Fenris, mages were treated a little differently than elsewhere. Here, they weren’t revered as supernatural beings standing above others, nor were they respected solely as intellectuals. Instead, mages were seen as slightly stronger, highly efficient _workers_. Most of their duties involved construction projects essential for the development of the territory. Of course, they weren’t restricted to manual labor alone. If a task required magical expertise, mages were deployed without hesitation. And even during war, Ghislain had not stopped developing new weapons. ― _“We can fight and work at the same time, right?”_ ― _“But we only have one body.”_ ― _“I’ll assign priests to you. With their recovery spells, you’ll effectively have double the time. Twice the time means it’s as good as having two bodies.”_ With sufficient magical recovery provided by priests, mages could function without rest, as they often had before the war. Thus, under their lord’s unrelenting will, mages participated in battles while simultaneously being involved in various production tasks. Priests, too, were assigned to both the battlefield and the recovery of fatigued workers. For the people of Fenris, this was business as usual. However, Jerome, who was unfamiliar with Fenris’s unique _culture_ , tilted his head in confusion. “What kind of work? Is there something I need to do?” He couldn’t understand what could possibly be more important than having a mage like him on the battlefield. Ghislain smiled warmly as he began to explain. “Our knights and soldiers wear special gear. But even with that, it’s not quite enough.” Fenris knights wore enchanted armor made from galvanium, a rare magical alloy. The soldiers, too, were equipped with full galvanium sets. While this gear already gave them overwhelming combat superiority compared to other armies, it wasn’t sufficient in Ghislain’s eyes. “Our knights activate the magic in their armor using their mana. But it’s hard to sustain during prolonged battles. That’s why we want to create some artifacts that don’t rely on their mana.” “Artifacts?” “Yeah. At the very least, I want every soldier to have a support weapon. Even something that lets them cast a few fireballs would be great.” Artifacts were magical tools imbued with specific spells. They were generally divided into two types: those requiring the user’s mana and those that didn’t. Naturally, artifacts that didn’t require mana were far more valuable and difficult to create. In fact, they were one of the primary sources of income for magical towers, though their production was notoriously challenging. Rare materials and exorbitant costs aside, the time required to create them increased exponentially for mages of lower circles. But Jerome was an 8th Circle mage, meaning he could craft artifacts at unparalleled speed. Jerome felt a bead of sweat form on his forehead. “Ar-artifacts? Do I really have to make them? Wouldn’t it be better for me to just fight on the battlefield?” “Of course, you’ll fight, too,” Ghislain assured him. “But boosting our overall combat power is just as critical. Hear me out.” The goal of this war wasn’t merely to defeat a few strong enemies but to completely annihilate them. Even with Jerome’s considerable strength, he couldn’t be everywhere at once. War required time, and the fastest way to reduce casualties and secure victory was by enhancing their army’s capabilities. When Ghislain finished explaining, he fixed Jerome with an intense, almost predatory gaze. “You can do it, can’t you? Of course, you can. You’re an 8th Circle mage. This is vital.” The main reason Fenris hadn’t mass-produced artifacts earlier was the sheer impracticality of it. They had lacked both the number of mages and the expertise required for such a project. Most mages were preoccupied with essential territorial tasks. Thanks to Vanessa reaching the 6th Circle, they had barely managed to outfit their knights with enchanted armor. It was only after the war brought in more mages that large-scale production became feasible. Ironically, the war also made it nearly impossible to focus on crafting. _But now you’re here, Jerome,_ Ghislain thought with a gleam in his eye. In his past life, Jerome had been a powerhouse in artifact creation. While he had fought on the battlefield, his true strength lay in his research and production capabilities. As the only 8th Circle mage at the time, Jerome had been responsible for leading countless innovative projects, from enchanted armors to monster-fighting contraptions. _I benefited so much from you back then. You’re incredible._ Of course, Jerome himself was oblivious to his own historical contributions. “Ugh… I hate this kind of stuff,” Jerome grumbled. Despite his immense talent, Jerome was known for his reluctance to work. His reputation back home as a slacker was well-earned. His master often lamented to their neighbors: ― _“He’s smart, but he doesn’t apply himself!”_ Jerome was that kind of person. Sensing his hesitation, Ghislain leaned in. “You won’t be doing this alone. Vanessa and the other mages have already started. You’re just helping out.” “Ugh…” “You’ll do it, right? We’re friends, aren’t we?” “Fine…” Jerome finally relented. He knew that enhancing their forces would save lives and turn the tide of the war. With newfound resolve, he nodded. “All right. But how do we do this? We can’t exactly mass-produce artifacts on the move.” He doubted they could create a proper workshop in their current situation. Galbaric stepped forward with a confident grin. “No need to worry! Fenris is always ready to work, no matter where we are.” “How?” Galbaric pointed toward a cluster of enormous wagons parked nearby. “Behold! The masterpiece of the great blacksmith Galbaric and his comrades: the _Mobile Workshop_!” _What the… this place is terrifying…_ Jerome’s jaw dropped as he stared at the massive wagons, each the size of a small house. An ominous sense of foreboding crept up his spine. Fenris wasn’t just crafting artifacts—they were doing it _on the move_! He had never seen or imagined anything like it. Ghislain, seizing the moment, clapped Jerome on the shoulder and spoke cheerfully. “Well, I’m off. I’ve got other matters to handle. Just hop on the Mobile Workshop and catch up with us later. Galbaric and Vanessa will fill you in on the details.” “Uh… okay.” Before Jerome could say another word, Ghislain disappeared into the distance, leaving him in the capable—and slightly intimidating—hands of Galbaric and Vanessa. Ghislain quickly led the mobile unit away, leaving only the mages, dwarves, and a few priests behind. Galbaric gave Jerome a friendly pat on the back and said, “Come on, get in. Everything’s all set up inside. Once we finish making the rune-embedded spears, all you need to do is work with the other mages to enchant them.” “Well… I suppose that’s fine,” Jerome muttered hesitantly. “But make sure you keep up the pace. If we’re slow, it’ll just make things harder for everyone.” “I-I understand. But enchanting 400 spears will take some time.” Fenris’s knights numbered around 400. Even if Jerome only had to imbue lower-circle enchantments and received help from other mages, completing that many spears would still take considerable time. But Galbaric looked at him with a puzzled expression. “400? Who said it’s just 400?” “Isn’t it? We need one for each knight, don’t we?” “Who told you that?” “Well… isn’t it normal for knights to use them?” Galbaric shook his head. “Nope, not here in Fenris. If it were just 400, we’d have finished ages ago.” “Then… how many?” “The goal is 20,000.” “I must’ve misheard. What did you say?” “I said 20,000. We need enough for the entire mobile unit. Right now, we’re about 16,000 short. We’ve been working on them nonstop, though.” Jerome’s jaw dropped as he glanced around at the other mages. “So that’s where those dark circles come from…” It wasn’t from the battlefield. It was from the sheer exhaustion of endless work. “No! Absolutely not! I can’t do it!” Nearby, Alfoy burst into hysterical laughter. “Hahaha! Like ya got a choice, newbie! Hah! You’re stuck with us! Ahahaha!” Even with blood dripping from his mouth, Alfoy couldn’t contain his amusement at Jerome’s predicament. Vanessa, her eyes dark and somber, spoke up. “You can do it!” “H-How am I supposed to?” “We’ve always done it.” “….” “It’s nothing once you get into the rhythm. Just think of it as the same day repeating over and over again.” For Vanessa, securing Jerome’s cooperation was non-negotiable. Even with all the mages pitching in, progress was slow. Lower-circle mages took far too long to perform basic enchantments, making their contributions marginal at best. While the recently joined 5th and 6th Circle mages helped, they couldn’t work quickly enough to meet the demand. As a result, Vanessa often had to lead the effort herself, with other mages supporting her. _‘That’s why we need Jerome to step up!’_ If Jerome, an 8th Circle mage, worked at full capacity, production speed would likely double. Seeing Jerome tremble in fear, Vanessa quickly added, “This is for the people! The faster we finish, the more lives we can save! It’s really not as bad as you think!” “Ugh…ugh…” Jerome couldn’t deny the logic. Equipping 20,000 soldiers with magical weapons capable of casting _Fireball_ would indeed be a game-changer. Even a single volley of magical attacks before a charge could completely disrupt the enemy’s formation. This was precisely the ideal assault strategy Ghislain had envisioned. _‘But do I really have to do it?’_ Jerome almost voiced his complaint but bit his tongue when he saw Vanessa’s determined expression. Resigned, he asked, “When… when do you need this done by?” A year? Two years? He figured that would be reasonable. Vanessa’s face lit up with a bright smile. “The sooner, the better. With you here, we should be able to finish in two months!” Galbaric, the dwarves, and the other mages all nodded in agreement. Jerome stared in disbelief. “Two months? Is that even possible?” It seemed physically impossible. While Jerome could endure days without food or sleep, the others certainly couldn’t. But then Piote chimed in. “At our current pace, it should be doable. If we manage our stamina and cut down on sleep…” Piote and the priests were already discussing a recovery plan. They had become seasoned experts at managing such projects alongside Fenris. Jerome thought to himself, _‘These people are insane…’_ Everyone seemed to treat this grueling workload as completely normal. Jerome began to question whether he was the odd one out. Galbaric shouted enthusiastically, “All right, let’s finalize the work plan on the way! Everyone, get on the wagons!” The workers, clearly accustomed to this routine, swarmed toward the massive wagons and quickly found their designated spots. Vanessa grabbed Jerome by the hand and led him toward a specific wagon. “This one’s for you, Jerome.” [For Mages Only] “….” The wagons were neatly labeled to indicate who belonged where. With a heavy sigh, Jerome stepped into the wagon. Inside, the spacious interior was filled with tools and an enormous pile of spears awaiting enchantment. _‘They even prepared a nameplate for me?’_ Jerome found his designated workspace, complete with a nameplate, and sat down. It felt as though this had all been prepared long before his arrival. _Rumble… Clank… Thud…_ The wagon doors closed, and thick iron bars slid into place. It felt less like a workshop and more like a prison cell. “….” Jerome blinked in silence, staring at the bars. A small hatch in the door opened, and Galbaric’s face appeared. “Normally, we’d do this in two shifts, but we’re short on time, so it’ll be nonstop for now. The door will only open for meals and breaks. Priests will stop by regularly to keep you fresh.” “….” “First time in Fenris, huh? Don’t take it too hard—it’s just how we do things. Don’t worry, we’ll keep you well-fed.” With that, Galbaric shut the hatch without a second thought. “….” Jerome couldn’t believe this was happening. He glanced around once more. “Let’s get started!” Vanessa called out energetically, prompting the mages to take their seats and begin working. Jerome thought to himself, _‘Ah… this is just how things are here. I’ve been too soft. I’ve had it too easy.’_ To protect his sanity, Jerome decided to accept his new reality. He might have made a mistake in befriending these people, but it was far too late to back out now. Resigned, he bowed his head and began his work. Meanwhile, Claude, who was leading the main unit, received word of Jerome’s addition to the ranks and muttered, “Fifty years should do for the new guy, right?” The Fenris domain continued to gain excellent workers, one by one.
