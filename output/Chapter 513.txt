The two armies stood face to face, emanating an aura of ferocity. The Delphine forces, having ridden relentlessly without rest or sustenance, were visibly exhausted. Yet their morale remained intact, bolstered by the presence of Kaien, the Kingdom’s Finest Sword, whom they believed would lead them to victory. Likewise, the Fenris Cavalry radiated an unyielding fighting spirit. Despite being more fatigued from their previous battles, their confidence in Ghislain left no room for doubt—they believed they could win any fight with him by their side. “Hmm.” Ghislain glanced over his shoulder, his gaze calm and calculating. Kaien mirrored the gesture. They both understood the situation. A full-scale charge could easily be ordered, but with both armies fatigued, the casualties would be immense. Though the Fenris troops were better equipped, Delphine’s numbers gave them the edge. With both sides composed of elites, there was no guarantee of victory for either. Neither Ghislain nor Kaien gave the order. Their thoughts were aligned. **"The outcome will be decided by us."** A faint smile tugged at Ghislain’s lips as he dismounted his black steed and stepped forward. To no one’s surprise, Kaien did the same, striding towards Ghislain with a calm yet imposing demeanor. The unspoken agreement between the two leaders was clear—there was no need to send their men to needless slaughter. One of them would fall, and the victor’s army would claim the spoils with minimal effort. As the two faced each other, Kaien unsheathed the massive dual-handed sword strapped to his back. “At last, I can put an end to you,” Kaien declared. “This time, there will be no escape.” Ghislain, in turn, discarded his spear, opting instead for the sword at his waist. “I’ve always wanted to cross swords with you. It seems I finally have my chance.” “Your arrogance ends today,” Kaien retorted, his voice cold and unwavering. “Once I cut you down, I’ll butcher your men and return to the southern front.” For Kaien, this duel was a golden opportunity. Killing Ghislain would allow him to return to the battlefield with his forces intact. Ghislain smirked at the declaration. “Quite confident, aren’t you? But even if you defeat me here, the southern front will already be in ruins.” “What?” Kaien’s face twisted in disbelief. Ghislain raised his blade and continued. “Do you think the army you abandoned can hold its own against the Northern forces? Do you even know who’s leading them?” “Who?” Kaien demanded. “Amelia.” The mention of her name made Kaien’s expression darken even further. Amelia had been a persistent thorn in the side of the Duke’s faction. After Desmond’s fall, she had taken substantial resources without directly attacking Fenris. Later, she had thwarted plans to use barbarians against Ferdium. Even in the early stages of the civil war, her sabotage of supply lines had delayed the 5th Corps’ advance. Though the Duke’s faction initially dismissed her as irrelevant, they were eventually forced to acknowledge her capabilities. And now, Amelia was once again interfering with their plans? Hearing her name ignited a burning rage in Kaien. Ghislain laughed mockingly, savoring Kaien’s growing frustration. “You followed me here, just as I predicted.” “That means…” “Yes, drawing you out here was part of the plan,” Ghislain admitted. “The Delphine forces left at the southern front will be crushed by Amelia. Do you think they can manage without you?” **Rumble!** Kaien’s mana erupted like a storm, radiating an aura of raw fury. Though he knew it was a trap, he had no choice but to take the bait. Had he not come, the Eclipse Castle would have fallen. Amidst the whirlwind of mana, Kaien’s lion-like mane of hair danced wildly as he spoke through gritted teeth. “The two brats from the North have ruined our grand plans.” Ghislain grinned. “Looks like you’re easily provoked.” **Fwoosh!** Kaien’s sword erupted with a massive aura blade, glowing intensely. His expression turned eerily calm, his voice steady. “No matter. I’ll kill you here, then head south and end Amelia as well.” Sometimes overwhelming strength was enough to crush even the most elaborate strategies. Kaien’s unwavering confidence was rooted in the unmatched power he wielded as the Kingdom’s Finest Sword. **Boom!** As Kaien stepped forward, the ground beneath him cracked and sank. With a seemingly casual motion, he swung his sword downward. The attack appeared deceptively slow. **Clang!** Ghislain raised his sword to block. In the blink of an eye, Kaien had closed the distance, his sword coming down with monstrous force. **Rumble!** The sheer weight of the blow drove Ghislain back, his feet digging furrows into the ground. Despite the pressure, a fierce grin spread across his face. This was it. This was the challenge he had been craving. **Fwoosh!** Dark energy enveloped Ghislain once more, his crimson eyes blazing brighter than ever. **Boom!** The two clashed again, their blades radiating red and blue light that exploded outward in shockwaves. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** Their swords never fully met. The aura emanating from each weapon clashed before the blades could connect, creating explosive bursts of energy. The resulting shockwaves ravaged the battlefield, leaving craters and storms in their wake. The brilliance of their attacks was so blinding that it obscured their movements entirely. **Boom!** With each exchange, Ghislain swallowed the blood rising in his throat. Kaien’s strikes carried an overwhelming force. **"As expected... the reputation of the Kingdom’s Finest Sword is well-deserved."** Kaien’s mastery was leagues above the lethargic Count Pallantz, who had grown complacent despite consuming a dragon heart. Kaien’s swordsmanship was flawless, devoid of unnecessary flair. His sword mirrored his resolute character—a testament to the pinnacle of a knight’s discipline. What stood out even more was Kaien’s immense mana reserve. **"His mana is on another level."** Even with Dark’s amplification, Ghislain struggled to withstand Kaien’s relentless power. Each block sent jolts of pain through his arms, making him fear he might lose his grip. Despite his rapid growth, Ghislain’s mana capacity was insufficient. He had already expended half his reserves breaking through Eloise’s illusions. Kaien, on the other hand, bore the marks of decades of unwavering training under optimal conditions. But Ghislain had one thing Kaien lacked—a lifetime of survival on the edge of death. **Whoosh!** **Slash!** In a fleeting moment, Ghislain’s sword nicked Kaien’s cheek, drawing blood. Ghislain’s movements grew sharper and more unpredictable. He abandoned direct clashes, favoring swift and precise strikes. His swordsmanship was honed not through noble duels but through countless life-or-death battles. It was a style born of desperation—a primal and adaptive technique. Kaien’s eyes widened in shock. **"What is this?!"** Though it seemed chaotic at first, Ghislain’s attacks were deceptively simple. His movements were stripped of excess, relying solely on slashes and thrusts. Yet Kaien couldn’t predict the trajectory of the blade. **"This... this doesn’t make sense!"** Each strike emerged from blind spots, aiming for lethal precision. It wasn’t merely a sword—it was a weapon of survival, a living, breathing extension of its wielder. Kaien clenched his jaw, his mind racing. **"This is not the swordsmanship of a man his age."** He, Kaien, had been raised among swords. Born into a prestigious lineage, he had mastered countless styles, refining them to forge his own. Through this process, he had created a world of his own—a perfect domain shaped by the sword alone. The sword had been with Kaien since birth, shaping his entire world. It was everything to him. For someone like him, becoming the Kingdom’s Finest Sword was not just destiny but an inevitable outcome. Yet now, standing before him was an opponent whose swordsmanship surpassed even his own—a swordsman who had surpassed Kaien’s will and enlightenment, the very foundation of his transcendence. **"This is impossible!"** Kaien, whose entire world was defined by the sword, could see it clearly: this swordsmanship carried the weight of time, a blade tempered through countless battles, soaked in blood, and hardened by survival. Even though Ghislain had fought numerous battles and earned his reputation as a war-crazed commander, such feats alone could not produce a sword like this. Such mastery required not years, but decades, even centuries of experience. Kaien’s instincts screamed the truth. **"This man... just who are you?"** **Boom!** Their blades clashed once more, the sound reverberating through the battlefield. The two men communicated through their swords, each strike growing fiercer, more precise. Kaien wielded his overwhelming mana like a storm, while Ghislain relied on his refined technique, built from countless life-and-death struggles. **"Master! Your mana reserves are nearly depleted!"** Dark’s frantic cry echoed in Ghislain’s mind. Unlike before, Ghislain’s body no longer suffered critical damage under immense power. Through rigorous training, he had expanded his capacity to withstand amplified energy. However, the energy still had to be used carefully. Overexerting himself would inevitably lead to catastrophic consequences. Ghislain had already drained a massive portion of his mana shattering Eloise’s illusions. Now, pouring every ounce of his remaining strength into the duel, even Dark’s reserves were reaching their limit. At this rate, he would burn out completely. **"It’s fine. Let it all go."** Ghislain ignored Dark’s pleas and continued to unleash his power. All that mattered was defeating the man before him. Once Kaien fell, the remaining forces would crumble with ease. Kaien was the pinnacle of the Duke’s military might. His defeat would symbolize the utter collapse of the Duke’s forces. Kaien, meanwhile, was thinking the exact same thing. Taking every blow head-on, Kaien relentlessly pressed forward. **"I only need to kill Ghislain."** Ghislain’s presence alone had shattered the Duke’s strategies and upended the balance of power across the continent. To Kaien, he was an anomaly—an unstoppable force. But the inverse was also true. Ghislain’s death would tilt the scales back in the Duke’s favor. **Boom!** The two clashed with full force, their blades reverberating with raw power. Kaien’s body was covered in countless wounds, blood pouring freely from each gash. Ghislain wasn’t unscathed either. Every swing of Kaien’s sword tore into the black aura surrounding him, peeling it away layer by layer. Finally, when Ghislain’s body was exposed beneath the dissipating aura... **Slash!** Kaien’s sword found its mark, carving a deep gash across Ghislain’s chest. **"Tch!"** Ghislain leaped back, avoiding a fatal blow, but the wound bled profusely. Kaien, noticing how slowly the wound healed, smirked. “It seems you don’t heal as quickly as before.” “Ah, well, I’m running low on energy right now.” Ghislain chuckled, unfazed. “You’ve got some fascinating abilities. A few more years, and even I wouldn’t be able to handle you.” “And in those years, you would’ve grown stronger too.” The two warriors grinned at each other. Regardless of their allegiances, there was a shared joy in crossing swords with a formidable opponent. Kaien raised his blade again, his voice steady. “If only you’d fought alongside us... we could’ve taken this continent with ease.” Ghislain shook his head, pointing his sword at Kaien. “In any lifetime, that would never happen.” “Then one of us must die here.” **Boom!** Kaien surged forward, unleashing another devastating strike. His remaining mana poured into each swing, pressing Ghislain back relentlessly. Ghislain struggled to keep up, each block driving him further toward his limits. His body threatened to falter under the immense pressure. **"Master! You’re in danger!"** **"It’s fine. Push harder."** Kaien’s relentless assault left Ghislain gasping for breath. Every clash sent tremors through his arms, threatening to disarm him. **"The weight of the Kingdom’s Finest Sword..."** Kaien’s mastery lived up to its legend. His skill, honed over decades, had forged him into a warrior as formidable as any of the continent’s seven strongest fighters. Ghislain, too, knew he was not yet at Kaien’s level. But he also knew that his experience held one decisive edge. **Whoosh!** **Slash!** Ghislain’s sword shifted suddenly, nicking Kaien’s cheek. The tide began to turn. Ghislain abandoned direct clashes, relying on swift, unpredictable movements. His blade danced like a predator, aiming for Kaien’s blind spots. Every strike was simple—slashing, thrusting—but carried deadly precision. Kaien’s eyes widened in disbelief. **"This... this is insane!"** The swordsmanship was primitive yet deadly. It wasn’t polished or elegant but raw, unrelenting, and alive. Kaien, a swordsman who had mastered countless techniques, couldn’t predict the blade’s trajectory. **"What kind of swordsmanship is this?!"** It wasn’t a style. It was survival incarnate—a technique honed by a man who had lived through hell. **"There’s no way a man his age could achieve this."** Kaien, born into nobility, had spent a lifetime perfecting his art. He had created his own domain, a world defined by his sword. But Ghislain’s blade carried an eternity of battles—a weapon shaped by blood, death, and survival. **Boom!** Their swords clashed again, sparks flying. Kaien poured every ounce of his remaining mana into his strikes. Ghislain, bloodied but grinning, met each blow with unyielding resolve. Kaien growled, his voice tinged with frustration and awe. “You... you’re extraordinary. No one has pushed me this far before.” “That’s my line.” “This ends now. You’ll be remembered as the greatest rival I’ve ever faced.” Kaien raised his sword high. Ghislain smirked, blood dripping from his lips. “Victory isn’t decided until the very end.” Kaien’s confidence faltered as an unexpected surge of mana engulfed the battlefield. **"What the—"** Kaien’s eyes darted around, searching for reinforcements. But there were none. When he turned back, Ghislain stood tall, his aura burning brighter than ever. “What... what are you doing?” Kaien demanded. Ghislain extended his blade, his grin widening. “Let’s start round two. I’ve regained a bit of my former strength.” The impossible had happened. Ghislain’s body now radiated immense energy, his **five mana cores** roaring to life.
