Upon reaching the village and settling in at an inn, Ghislain stood before a mirror. "Hmm…" Dark circles hung heavily under his eyes, and he looked utterly exhausted. It was no wonder Astion’s complexion in the dream had looked so terrible. "This possession isn’t exactly a natural process. And I’ve been recklessly using my power on top of that..." Possession wasn’t just about fatigue; it disrupted the balance between mind and body. While possession allowed access to the host’s knowledge and skills, it also demanded a steep price. Most possessors left their hosts before any severe side effects could manifest. However, Ghislain had gone far beyond those limits. Ghislain’s consciousness was vast. Without a powerful body honed alongside such a consciousness, it was impossible to sustain him. Astion’s still-developing body wasn’t capable of enduring Ghislain’s immense presence. If Ghislain hadn’t exerted so much power, he might have lasted longer. "I wasn’t even using my full strength. Tsk, tsk." He smirked bitterly and cracked his back. The more he relied on this body for training and combat, the faster it would deteriorate. There was only one solution. "I need to elevate this body’s capabilities." Magic was a tool to bend the laws of the world. If he could master it, it would temporarily alleviate the disconnect between mind and body. By increasing Astion’s magical level, Ghislain could extend his control over the host and stabilize their connection. "I have to strengthen these three as quickly as possible before this body gives out." Ghislain couldn’t help but feel a sense of urgency. The demonic threat had yet to materialize, but if he were forced out of this body prematurely, he needed to leave a strong foundation for the three. After assigning them self-directed training, Ghislain called out to Astion within the shared consciousness. "Hey, wake up." — Ugh, give me back my body… You’re breaking the balance. My body can’t handle your power… Astion was well aware of what was happening to his body. Though he existed in a spiritual form now, his physical vessel was reaching its limit. Ghislain responded bluntly. "Well, maybe you should’ve been doing push-ups or something. How could you let your body get so weak? But don’t worry, I’ve got a solution. I’ll raise your magical level, so just let me handle it." — You idiot! Give me back my body so I can train my magic myself! "Relax. I’ll do it for you. Just tell me what magic you know." — What’s the point if you don’t even learn it properly? "I’m aiming for 9th-circle magic." — Are you insane?! Magic isn’t that simple! You have to study formulas and achieve enlightenment to use it! Astion had once tried to teach Ghislain some basic spells. However, now that his body was breaking down, he realized the specifics of Ghislain’s effort—or lack thereof—didn’t matter anymore. Ghislain shrugged nonchalantly. "There’s no need to overcomplicate things. I’ll figure it out by doing. Just demonstrate the magic, and I’ll learn through observation." — What?! That’s not how this works! "If the body’s strong, the mind won’t need to work as hard." … Astion couldn’t help but feel that was backward. He asked cautiously, his voice filled with doubt. — Can I even take control of my body again? "You can if you suppress my consciousness temporarily. That’ll let you use your body for a bit." — Wait. You mean you’ve been able to return my body all this time but just didn’t?! "Don’t be petty." — ... Astion was left speechless. This guy had deliberately withheld his body, even though he could’ve returned it at any time. "Don’t overthink it. I have my reasons. Besides, this body’s mine now—or at least, it is for the time being." — ... Astion wanted to tell Ghislain to just go back to his own body, but he held back. This was his chance to regain control. — Fine. Let’s do it. I’ll cast magic with my body. Astion smirked inwardly. Once he took control, he vowed never to let Ghislain take over again. With newfound resolve, Astion agreed. Ghislain led the way to the inn’s backyard, where Deneb was training. "Hey, Ghislain, are you okay? Want me to heal you?" "I’m fine. I’m about to start training in magic." "Magic?" "Yeah, it never hurts to learn. It’ll come in handy in life." Magic wasn’t just for combat—it had countless practical applications. This was why most magicians tended to neglect physical training. Ghislain had always wanted to learn magic, but studying spell formulas required time and effort. With his focus on physical training, he never had the chance to delve into it. However, by using Astion’s body, he could directly experience the flow of mana. He planned to learn through action rather than theory. "Alright, I’ll suppress my consciousness. Go ahead." Suppressing his own consciousness was a trivial task for Ghislain. As he closed his eyes, the figures of the three training mercenaries blurred in his vision. Moments later, Astion opened his eyes, now in control of his body. "I’m back! I’m back in my body!" Still in disbelief, Astion looked around and shouted, "Julien! Deneb! Kyle! It’s me, Astion!" Julien hesitated before asking, "Are you… really Astion?" "Yes! I’ve finally regained control!" The three exchanged suspicious glances. Knowing Ghislain’s penchant for deception, they wondered if this was just another trick. Frustrated by their doubt, Astion shouted, "I’m telling you, I’m really Astion!" Kyle scanned the surroundings and exclaimed, "It must be true! Dark is gone!" The ever-watchful Dark, who usually stayed by their side during training, had indeed vanished. Convinced, the three finally believed Astion. "Whoo-hoo!" They cheered instinctively, relieved to have a break from Ghislain’s intense presence. Kyle was the first to speak. "Hey, let’s celebrate! Take out the money! We should eat well and enjoy ourselves tonight." As the group’s unofficial treasurer, Kyle immediately grabbed the pouch hanging from Astion’s waist and began pulling out gold coins. "Wow, Astion, look at this! Do you know how much we’ve earned?" But as Kyle continued to pull out coins, he noticed a strange shift in the atmosphere. When he looked up, Astion was smiling softly—a little too softly. Something felt off. "You’re not… are you?" Astion said nothing, his smile unwavering. "You’re not Ghislain, are you?" Still smiling, Astion reached for a staff. Kyle’s eyes widened, and he scrambled backward in panic. The three quickly pretended not to notice and returned to their training with renewed vigor. Watching them, Ghislain clicked his tongue. "Tsk. They always think about slacking off the moment they get the chance. They’ll regret it if they keep that up." Ghislain’s comment was about the looming battle with the demonic beasts, but the three misunderstood, thinking he was referring to their inevitable punishment. Though exhausted, the trio pushed themselves harder than ever, determined not to incur Ghislain’s wrath again. Astion, frustrated and humiliated, roared at the heavens. "You wretched Ghislain! I’ll make you pay for this!" But the three ignored him, too focused on their training. Astion finally understood. Even if he regained his body, he couldn’t overcome the overwhelming presence of Ghislain’s consciousness. "Fine… I’ll show you magic," he muttered. Grudgingly, Astion began to cast a spell under Ghislain’s watchful eye. "This is a 1st-circle spell: Light." Fwoosh! A small orb of light flickered to life. Standing in front of the mirror at the inn, Ghislain observed Astion’s reflection as he experimented with magic. He could vividly feel the flow of mana as Astion cast spells. The more spells were cast, the clearer the sensation became, imprinting itself into his mind. Fwoosh! Astion cast a 2nd-circle Fireball spell repeatedly, his flames flickering in the empty air as if he were practicing alone. After several demonstrations, Astion turned with a smug expression and said, "So? Still don’t get it, right? Without understanding the formulas, you can’t use magic. It takes a lot of study." Astion had no choice but to learn magic through the memories of his past hosts. His hard work had given him a sense of pride. Magic was not something one could learn just by observing—it required dedication and deep understanding. Ghislain, now back in control, quietly observed the body. "Hmm… so that’s how it works." Having already reached a state of enlightenment far beyond that of an ordinary person, Ghislain quickly memorized the intricate flow of mana and its patterns. "Let’s see… shall we try this?" He extended a hand. Casting magic was a complex process. One had to manipulate mana according to specific formulas, imbue it with intent, and adjust the flow based on the desired effect. It required intense concentration and visualization. But Ghislain laughed as he toyed with the mana in the air. "It’s like solving a puzzle." For someone like him, calculations weren’t necessary. He rearranged the mana exactly as he had seen and felt it. The air rippled slightly as the mana gathered and took form. FWOOSH! A large flame suddenly burst into existence, flickering brilliantly in the air. This was magic—the art of reshaping reality, imposing new phenomena as if they had always belonged. It was a craft that required both the precise control of mana and the willpower to enforce one’s intent. "Too easy," Ghislain muttered, smiling at the flame hovering before him. Astion, who had been watching, was utterly flabbergasted. — H-How…? How could someone who didn’t know a single formula succeed in casting magic just by observing the flow of mana? It was absurd. Even if one could sense the flow, it was impossible to accurately channel intent without understanding the formulas. That’s why enlightenment was so highly valued among magicians. What Astion didn’t know was that Ghislain had transcended ordinary willpower. He was someone who could command the very world to align with his desires. Minor inaccuracies were corrected by the world itself when Ghislain imposed his will. The only downside was that he couldn’t create entirely new spells—he was limited to replicating what he’d seen. "Well, that’s what Astion is for." Ghislain could simply observe Astion casting spells and learn them. The hard work of studying formulas would remain Astion’s burden, while Ghislain reaped the benefits. Who else could live such a dream-like existence? Astion, still reeling, shouted, "How did you DO that?!" "As I said, a strong body makes for an easy mind," Ghislain replied nonchalantly. "That’s not a thing! It’s so unfair!" Ignoring Astion’s protests, Ghislain continued experimenting with the newly learned spell. Whoosh! Boom! Bang! Dozens of fireballs appeared and disappeared in rapid succession. "This is actually pretty fun." Even reaching the 7th circle would open up countless tactical possibilities in combat, not to mention the conveniences magic would provide in everyday life. In his own reality, becoming a magician would’ve required years of study. But possessing Astion’s body allowed him to skip all the hard work. He couldn’t help but feel grateful for the Saintess’s guidance. "I still have some fragments of the Atriel Dragon Heart left." While the heart couldn’t be fully restored, the fragments contained immense mana. Absorbing them would significantly increase his mana reserves. Of course, he needed to master as much magic as possible before returning to his world. "So, where can I find more spellbooks?" Astion was a low 5th-circle magician. Even with knowledge from his past hosts, he didn’t know every spell. Astion, still sulking, replied reluctantly. — Spellbooks are hard to come by… especially advanced ones. Magicians guard their knowledge fiercely. Ghislain nodded. That much hadn’t changed since his time. No matter how talented someone was, they couldn’t cast spells without understanding the formulas. But Ghislain was a problem solver by nature. "If spellbooks are rare, then we’ll just have to find some magicians to, ah… persuade." If the books weren’t readily available, he’d simply go to those who owned them. A magician in possession of rare spellbooks would make for an excellent target. Ghislain’s eyes gleamed with mischief as he plotted his next move.
