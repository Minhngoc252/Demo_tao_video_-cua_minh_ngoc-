At Claude's words, Marquis Perain responded with a bright smile. “Oh, so you’re from this kingdom? Which noble house do you hail from?” “I am not a noble,” Claude replied plainly. “Ah… I see,” Perain muttered, his expression slightly souring. The nobles around exchanged subtle glances, their discomfort evident. Having their affairs investigated was already an affront, but to have it done by someone who wasn’t even a noble? However, this man had arrived with a formidable army of 100,000 soldiers and carried the authority of the Steward of Fenris. Even seasoned aristocrats couldn’t outright oppose him. Little did they know, Claude had once been a slave. “Let us move somewhere more private,” Marquis Perain suggested with a relieved smile, mistaking Claude for someone who might sympathize with them as a native of the kingdom. Claude shook his head. “I’ll begin the investigation immediately.” “What urgency is this?” “I’m a busy man. Move, now!” At Claude’s command, the Fenris administrators stormed into the royal palace with soldiers, sifting through documents without restraint. Claude had returned to Ceyron with every intention of overturning it. Ghislain, fully aware of his circumstances, had handed him full authority and stepped back. Marquis Perain and the nobles protested, their voices rising. “What is the meaning of this insolence?” “No matter how much aid you’ve given us, this goes too far!” “Do you think us weaklings to be trampled on?” Claude ignored them completely. His administrative officers and knights treated the royal palace as if it were their own, rummaging through every corner with the audacity of an invading army. The nobles, unprepared for such a scenario, were left dumbfounded. Even if they wanted to stop them, they couldn’t. The Northern Army exuded a menacing presence. With a mere gesture from Claude, the entire kingdom could have been leveled. While the palace was being upended, Claude leisurely made his way to meet the King of Ceyron. King Cordeno, who had been eagerly awaiting a celebratory banquet, now sat pale-faced, trembling with suppressed rage. “What is the meaning of this? What are you doing?” he demanded, his voice shaking. Claude flashed a serene smile. “Simply conducting a little investigation.” “Leave immediately! This humiliation cannot be tolerated! Return the aid if you must, but leave my kingdom at once!” Now that the Rifts had been cleared, production facilities could be restored. Though it would take time, it wasn’t an impossible task. Returning the aid seemed like a reasonable solution. But Claude shook his head. “I’m afraid there’s more to look into.” “A foreign steward dares to investigate further? Ceyron is a sovereign nation! You claim to be of this land—how can you disgrace the place where you were born and raised?” Cordeno roared in anger, but his palace knights did not act. They knew that opposing Fenris’s forces would mean instant ruin for their kingdom, which had no superhumans to defend it. Claude turned to the furious king and spoke calmly. “Do you not recognize me?” “How could I know every steward of a foreign land?” Claude turned his gaze to Marquis Perain. “And you, do you not recognize me?” “I… I do not,” the marquis stammered. Claude chuckled softly. He remembered all too well the time when he had been dragged alongside his master, Benedict, accused of treason. Marquis Perain and King Cordeno had both been present then, condemning Benedict to death. _“Ah, that’s right,”_ Claude thought bitterly. _“To them, I was nothing but an insect—unworthy even of being remembered.”_ But that didn’t matter. He would make sure they never forgot him from now on. Facing Cordeno once more, Claude declared, “You will never forget my face or name again.” “What nonsense are you spouting? Guards! Remove him at once! Return the aid and make him leave!” Claude spoke in a low, deliberate tone. “My master’s name was Benedict.” “What… what did you say?” Cordeno and Perain’s eyes widened in shock. Benedict was the man they had falsely accused of treason and executed years ago. And now, here stood his disciple—one of Fenris’s most trusted allies. “You… you’re…” Cordeno’s voice faltered as he struggled to recall Claude’s face. The years had obscured his memory, but now it became clear. The nobles of Ceyron, too, began to break out in cold sweat as the pieces fell into place. Claude smiled coldly and said, “You violated the terms of the agreement and embezzled the aid. You will repay everything from the royal treasury immediately.” Pale and trembling, Marquis Perain stammered, “We… we don’t have the means to return it right now.” Although they had hoarded food and limited distributions to soldiers, they hadn’t been able to completely avoid using the supplies. Feeding themselves, their knights, and their private troops had consumed a significant portion. “If that’s the case, you’re bankrupt. I’ll take the equivalent amount in land, with interest.” “Th-that’s absurd…” “How is it absurd? It’s a perfectly legitimate process.” It was common practice for nobles unable to repay their debts to cede territory instead. While the reasoning was sound, the nobles couldn’t help but see this as Claude’s personal vendetta now that they knew his identity. “What… what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?” “You still don’t understand?” Claude sneered. “I-I don’t…” “My master was falsely accused of treason and executed. What do you think his disciple would do in response?” “Th-this must be a misunderstanding…” “Misunderstanding? You all knew he was innocent. But you condemned him anyway, framing him for treason. Shall I tell you how to make that injustice right?” “W-what…?” Claude’s eyes burned with fury as he bared his teeth. “By committing actual treason. That way, his death won’t have been in vain.” “What nonsense are you spewing?” “I am committing treason as a native of Ceyron, fulfilling my master’s legacy. And I’m doing it with foreign forces at my side.” “Y-you madman…” “You’ve already given me the justification. By embezzling the aid, you provided all the reason I needed. Arrest them all.” _Boom!_ At Claude’s command, the doors to the royal chamber shattered as Northern Army soldiers stormed in. “Defend the king!” Marquis Perain shouted, but it was futile. Within moments, the Fenris knights subdued Ceyron’s guards and captured the king and nobles, forcing them to their knees. The nobles gritted their teeth, seething with humiliation. They had welcomed their invaders into the palace, only to be utterly betrayed. Claude looked down at them, his smile as sharp as a blade. “I sent far more aid to this kingdom than necessary. How did you enjoy it?” “Y-you…” “I expected you to violate the agreement. That’s just the kind of people you are.” “You bastard…” Cordeno's face turned crimson with rage as he trembled in fury. Initially, he had gleefully squandered the supplies, ensuring his own circle was well-fed while withholding them from the people. But now, those resources had been turned into a debt. Only now did he understand why they had made a formal agreement when offering the aid. _This man had planned it all along,_ Cordeno realized, _using the contract as justification to take over the kingdom._ Sitting on the throne, Claude announced calmly, “As a traitor to Ceyron, I hereby assume the position of interim governor on behalf of the royal family of Rutania. This authority was granted by our great king and the Grand Duke of the North. Once the war with the Salvation Church is over, this land will be annexed into the Rutania Kingdom.” “You wretch! Silence! Do you think the other kingdoms will simply stand by and let this happen? This is outright invasion—an invasion disguised as aid!” United under one rule, Rutania was far stronger than any neighboring kingdom, and the prospect of its expansion would surely terrify others. But Claude only chuckled dismissively. “This is merely an internal rebellion within the Kingdom of Ceyron,” he said with a smirk. “And I’ve provided ample justification.” “You bastard!” Revenge had brought Claude back here, and with his military power, no one could contest his authority. Claude’s grin grew sharper. “Take them away. We’ll investigate their crimes and mete out appropriate punishments.” Those directly involved in his master’s death would face the ultimate penalty. “Let go of me! Release me, you scum! You invaders!” Cordeno thrashed and screamed, but his protests were in vain. The Northern Army had already taken full control of the palace. And thus, the Kingdom of Ceyron met its end. There was no way to stop Claude, who had come fully prepared to overthrow the kingdom. With the king and the high-ranking nobles deposed, Claude swiftly began stabilizing the region. The soldiers of Ceyron were reorganized and fed well. Resources were distributed generously to the refugees, and thanks to the supplies Claude had seized, there was no shortage. Naturally, the soldiers and commoners cheered. The fate of the king and nobles was of little concern to them, as they had felt nothing but betrayal when they learned about the embezzlement of the aid. “They’re giving us so much food!” “Rutania truly is remarkable!” “I heard a rumor we might become part of the Rutania Kingdom.” “Wouldn’t that be amazing? Their military is strong, and they’ve got plenty of food!” As rumors of annexation spread, excitement rippled through the people. They had witnessed firsthand the power of Rutania’s army, which had eradicated the Rifts in mere days—something Ceyron hadn’t managed to do even once. Now, they were being fed abundantly. If given the choice, many would gladly hand their country over themselves. And when the official news of annexation broke, the response was unprecedented. “Hurrah!” “All hail the Kingdom of Rutania!” “All hail the Grand Duke of the North!” A bizarre spectacle unfolded: the people of a conquered nation celebrating its annexation. After all, they had lived like slaves under their own government, tired of a monarchy and nobility that hoarded wealth while ignoring the kingdom’s problems. With most of the populace rejoicing, Claude’s “rebellion” proceeded without a hitch. Roughly 10,000 Northern Army soldiers were left behind to stabilize the region, the minimum necessary to maintain order. The bulk of the forces immediately followed Ghislain to aid another kingdom. Although Claude had been appointed interim governor, his true priority was a deeply personal matter. He needed to find Anna. “Still no news?” Most of Ceyron’s population had fled to the area near the capital. Even the headmaster and students of the Ceyron Academy had been found there. But none of them knew where Anna was. She had been away at another academy when the Rift crisis began. The baron, Austin, who had held Anna hostage to raise her ransom, was reportedly already dead. Everyone involved in his master’s death had also been dealt with. Now, all that remained was finding Anna, but her whereabouts were a mystery. “Hah…” Claude let out a frustrated sigh. It wasn’t as though he hoped to rekindle anything with Anna. His guilt weighed heavily on him, and he wanted nothing more than to ensure her safety as his former lover and his master’s daughter. Seeing Claude so troubled, Wendy approached him cautiously. “…Are you alright?” “I’m fine,” he replied with a bitter smile. But his expression only made Wendy more anxious. She had never seen Claude, who was always sharp-tongued and lively, look so serious. For some reason, the sight left an ache in her chest. “Well, I guess it’s time to move,” Claude said reluctantly. With no other options, he decided to leave Anna’s search in the hands of the administrators. He couldn’t afford to linger any longer, as he needed to rejoin the Northern Army. Ghislain had allocated forces and time specifically for Claude’s revenge, but now that it was complete, he had to resume his duties. Before departing, Claude made one last round of the refugee camp, hoping against hope for a miracle. “Hm?” As he wandered, he spotted a familiar face. The man immediately tried to turn away and slip out of sight. “Hey! Hey! Stop that bastard!” Claude shouted. Soldiers quickly apprehended the fleeing man and dragged him back. He gave Claude an awkward smile. “G-governor! It’s been a while. How have you been?” The man grinned sheepishly, his demeanor utterly spineless. It was Crank, the gang leader who had once tried to cut off Claude’s hand.
