Thud, thud, thud, thud! The Cyclopes, hurling boulders at the fortress, turned their enormous heads toward the sound of rapidly approaching hoofbeats. Humans on horseback were charging fearlessly toward them, their audacity infuriating the giants. "KAAARGH!" One Cyclops lifted a massive boulder and flung it toward the riders. The boulder, colossal in size, had been gathered from the fortress for defensive use. If it hit, it would annihilate the knights’ formation. Fwoosh! Seeing the oncoming boulder, Ghislain’s crimson eyes glinted. Fwoooosh! Dozens of magical spears materialized around him and shot forward, aimed at the boulder. BOOOOM! The boulder shattered into countless fragments, harmlessly scattering as Ghislain and his knights raced forward without hesitation. "KAAARGH!" All five Cyclopes turned their blazing red eyes toward Ghislain and his knights. The approaching humans exuded a dangerous, overwhelming presence that made the monsters instinctively wary. "KAAARGH!" Abandoning their attack on the fortress, the Cyclopes redirected their rage toward Ghislain’s group, picking up more boulders and hurling them with terrifying force. BOOM! BOOM! BOOOM! Each boulder was intercepted by Ghislain’s magical spears, shattering before they could land. Realizing their projectiles were useless, the Cyclopes roared and grabbed their massive clubs—logs the size of small trees, capable of staggering even a dragon. "KAAARGH!" Ghislain smirked at their display of fury. “Kong, it’s time to go wild again,” he said softly to his black steed. "NEEEEIGH!" Ghislain’s crimson eyes burned brighter, and a dark, pulsating aura surrounded him and his horse, cloaking them in power. Thud, thud, thud, thud! Cyclopes were formidable adversaries, each wielding strength akin to superhuman warriors. Yet, Ghislain showed no fear. His knights were more than capable of holding their ground against such foes. Gripping his enormous greatsword, Ghislain shouted, “Gillian! Kaor! Each of you, take one! The rest, scatter and contain the others!” To his left and right, Gillian and Kaor rode alongside him, their own greatswords glowing with concentrated aura. Ziiiing—! The Fenris Knights' black armor emitted a radiant glow, infused with mana from their enhanced gear. Thud, thud, thud, thud! The thunderous gallop of the Fenris cavalry echoed through the battlefield as they charged with unrelenting ferocity into the heart of the monster horde. The knights’ faces were alight with fierce, almost ecstatic grins. For the Fenris Knights, fear was an alien concept. "Charge first into the most dangerous place." This was not just their motto but the core of their identity. Trained and prepared for moments like this, they had become the strongest and most disciplined knights on the continent. BOOOOM! The cavalry smashed into the monster horde like a meteor, scattering enemies in every direction. Monsters that had been rushing toward the fortress were torn apart by the knights’ relentless assault. Each knight was a master of their craft, some even surpassing the limits of ordinary humans. The monsters fell like leaves in the face of their might. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The area between the Cyclopes and the fortress rapidly cleared as the knights carved a path through the chaos. ROOOAR! Thud, thud, thud! The Cyclopes roared, their eyes blazing with fury as they charged at Ghislain. One Cyclops, leading the charge, swung its massive club down toward him with earth-shaking force. BOOOOM! The ground quaked as the club smashed into it, but Ghislain had already evaded the blow with incredible precision. Guiding his horse deftly, he surged toward the Cyclops’s ankle. SLASH! Ghislain’s greatsword bit into the thick, iron-like flesh of the Cyclops’s ankle. Though the blade cut deep, it wasn’t enough to sever the limb completely. Ghislain’s aura flared as his will bent reality itself. Time seemed to freeze as the flow of the world shifted in his favor. CRACK! When time resumed, the Cyclops’s ankle was cleanly severed. The massive beast toppled, crimson blood spurting from its wound like a geyser. THUD! The Cyclops fell to one knee, roaring in confusion and agony. It couldn’t comprehend what had happened. Its thick hide should have been enough to withstand such an attack. "KAAARGH!" Ghislain didn’t stop. Urging his horse forward, he weaved through the chaos as another Cyclops tried to crush him underfoot. THUD! With a sharp tug on the reins, Ghislain’s horse twisted and dodged the attack with almost supernatural grace. Thud, thud, thud! Empowered by Ghislain’s mana, the black steed moved like a shadow, effortlessly avoiding every strike. Ghislain’s sword continued to cut through the surrounding monsters, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Meanwhile, Gillian and Kaor had engaged separate Cyclopes, keeping them occupied. Though they couldn’t overpower the giants, their skill was enough to hold the monsters at bay. This allowed the Fenris Knights to focus on the smaller monsters, pushing them back toward the fortress. "KAAARGH!" The Cyclopes grew more enraged, their massive clubs smashing down repeatedly as they tried to swat Ghislain away. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! But Ghislain danced around their attacks with ease, his movements as fluid as a shadow in the wind. His relentless assault whittled down their forces, leaving the battlefield eerily empty. By the time the dust settled, the monsters around Ghislain had all been slain—many of them crushed by the Cyclopes’ own misguided attacks. BOOM! BOOM! BOOOOM! Dodging the relentless barrage of massive clubs, Ghislain took a deep breath. “Huff!” A fierce red light enveloped the greatsword in his hand. Ghislain struck at the ankle of another Cyclops. CRACK! Once again, the blade hit resistance. The Cyclops's skin was too thick and tough for even the aura-blade to slice through easily. But as Ghislain poured his will into the blade, the Cyclops's ankle gave way. "KAAARGH!" THUD! The Cyclops, its massive frame unable to bear its weight, collapsed to the ground. Blood began trickling from Ghislain’s nose, evidence of the toll his exertions were taking on his body. Even using the power of his will for a brief moment strained him. Yet Ghislain didn’t stop. Holding back in this situation would have been a luxury he couldn’t afford. Thud, thud, thud, thud! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The Cyclopes, now completely fixated on Ghislain, roared and flailed, trying desperately to crush him. Weaving skillfully with his black steed, Ghislain struck at the ankle of yet another Cyclops. SLASH! CRUNCH! THUD! The third Cyclops wobbled as it lost its balance and toppled to the ground. Finally, three of the massive giants had their ankles severed. The legendary giants struggled to rise but found it nearly impossible to support their mountainous frames on their mutilated legs. "KAAARGH!" The Cyclopes screamed in rage and agony, thrashing their enormous clubs in every direction. If they could land just one hit, it would all be over—but Ghislain never gave them that chance. As the Cyclopes' movements were further restricted, Ghislain channeled even more mana. Although he had already crippled their ankles, their colossal size still made their attacks lethal. He needed to be faster, sharper. "GAAARGH!" Ghislain activated the fifth level of his core. Avoiding the use of his willpower further, he resolved to fight using only his core's strength. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! With every blow, the Cyclopes' attacks shattered the earth, causing small quakes. Despite the unstable terrain, Ghislain’s black steed danced gracefully, moving as if it were one with its master. Fwoosh! With each movement, Ghislain carved new wounds into the Cyclopes' bodies. Though he primarily targeted their lower halves due to the height difference, he occasionally struck at their arms as they swung their clubs. "KAAARGH!" The Cyclopes were losing their minds. The tiny human darted around them like an insect, yet catching him seemed an impossible feat. One well-placed hit would end it, but that one hit never came. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The Cyclopes' frenzied attacks and Ghislain's relentless counters continued, their repetitive exchange gradually wearing down the giants. Their arms, thighs, and calves were now tattered and bloodied, their strength waning. Meanwhile, Gillian and Kaor kept two other Cyclopes occupied. Though they couldn’t deal as much damage as Ghislain, they succeeded in drawing the monsters' attention and inflicting minor wounds. This shift in focus first became evident at the fortress. “It’s working.” Jerome’s eyes gleamed. He no longer needed to defend against the Cyclopes' indiscriminate boulder attacks. Turning his gaze skyward, Jerome saw that the sky was still swarming with black clouds of flying monsters. “Time to get started.” Smiling faintly, Jerome murmured to himself. The monsters climbing the fortress walls could be left to Belinda. His focus would be the sky. “Hoo…” He exhaled deeply, gathering his strength. Until now, Jerome had been maintaining layered spells, deflecting projectiles while holding off ground and aerial monsters. But now, he concentrated all his energy into a single spell. While simple in principle, it would carry immense power. He trusted Belinda and the soldiers to hold the line while he prepared. CRACKLE! A bluish light began to course through Jerome’s fingers. The light moved like a living creature, flowing between his fingers with a hypnotic dance. As it moved, it grew brighter and more intense. When it reached his palm, the lightning expanded explosively, swirling like a storm. In moments, the electricity surged up his arm. ZZZT! As it reached his shoulder, it seemed to pause momentarily—a deceptive calm before the storm. FLASH! Suddenly, Jerome’s eyes lit up, glowing with a vivid blue light. As he extended his arm, the lightning moved in accordance with his will. In a low, commanding voice, Jerome spoke: “Chain Lightning.” KRAAAACK! A bolt of lightning shot from Jerome’s fingertips, branching out like tree limbs through the air. The magic struck its first target with devastating precision, then leapt to a second, its power amplified. The lightning surged relentlessly, tearing through the monsters with merciless efficiency. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The battlefield lit up like daytime under the glow of Jerome’s magic. The blue streaks of lightning danced across the sky, illuminating every corner of the battlefield. KRAAAAAACK! When the spell reached its climax, the thunderous roar of the lightning seemed to swallow the world whole. And then, a deafening silence fell. Shhhhhhh… Archers and mages stationed at the rear froze, momentarily stunned. The black clouds that had obscured the sun began to dissipate, allowing rays of light to pierce through the gloom. As for the flying monsters that had filled the sky... More than half of them had been reduced to ashes, scattering in the wind.
