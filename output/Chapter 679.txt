“Dark!” Belinda was the first to rush into the room, shouting loudly. Sure enough, a mass of black energy hovered near Ghislain, who remained lying down. The entity, unmistakably Dark, floated mid-air like a blackened shadow. The others quickly followed, their voices overlapping in panic. “What’s going on with the young master?” “Is His Grace safe?” “Is Ghislain alright?” The atmosphere turned chaotic, resembling a bustling marketplace. Dark roared in frustration, his voice sharp. “Silence! Listen to me first! There’s no time!” Belinda, grabbing hold of Dark's shadowy form, demanded, “What do you mean, no time? What’s happening to the young master?” “He’s fine! Everything’s fine! It’s just… time here flows differently!” “Time… flows differently?” “Yes! Time is passing much faster on your side! Now, shut up and listen!” “Alright, alright, we’re listening!” Dark straightened, his tone turning more formal. “First, he wants me to tell you not to worry. He couldn’t explain things beforehand because he wasn’t certain how it would play out. He just wants you to wait. He’ll return safely—anytime now!” “Where is he? Where exactly?” Dark, his tone brimming with a strange pride, answered, “We’re in the past! A thousand years ago! Back when the Magus Age and the Opposer still existed!” Everyone froze in shock. Jerome’s hypothesis had been correct. Jerome quickly stepped forward, taking on the role of spokesman. “Alright, let me ask the important questions! Is Ghislain really inhabiting Astion’s body? The Astion—the first master of the Tower of Radiance?” Dark’s shadowy form jolted in surprise. “How did you know that? Well, whatever. Yeah, we took over that guy’s body!” The pride in Dark’s tone left the room stunned. “You really… took over the body of our tower’s first master?” “Yup! It’s ours now!” “...” Everyone fell into a bewildered silence. Ghislain had always been someone who liked to take things—whether they were territories or treasures—but taking someone’s body? How were they supposed to process this? Though it was more accurate to say it was a symbiotic relationship, Dark’s lack of detail made it sound more like theft. Dark rambled on, his tone hurried. “While we’re talking here, time is racing by on your side! The temporal axis is completely different!” “How… how fast? Do you even have time to explain properly?” “Nope! The boss only sent me here because he was worried you’d be freaking out! He’s settled in and focused on training right now! Anything else you need to know? If not, I’m heading back!” Ghislain had apparently secured a temporary base in the Magus Age, choosing to dedicate his time to training. Dark had taken advantage of a brief opportunity to deliver the message before disappearing again. The explanation offered some relief to the group. Though it was shocking to learn that Ghislain had traveled a thousand years into the past, it was comforting to know he was alive and active. The idea of someone living in the past seemed absurd, but with Dark’s confirmation, they had no choice but to believe it. While most were left dumbfounded, Jerome didn’t waste the chance to ask more questions. “Did he really meet the saintess? The hero? Or has he not met them yet?” “He met them! He really did!” The room collectively gasped in amazement. The saintess and the hero—legendary figures said to have saved the world and sealed away the Opposer. To meet such mythical people seemed unbelievable. Jerome, his excitement growing, pressed further. “What are they like? How strong are they? How incredible are they supposed to be?” Before he could finish, Dark burst out laughing, his shadowy form shaking with mirth. “Those guys? They’re complete idiots!” “...” “No, seriously. I thought they’d be amazing, too, but they’re just a bunch of clueless fools. The boss is so fed up he’s training them himself—beating sense into them as he goes!” “...” “That’s how it always is with legends. Over time, everything gets so inflated it sounds incredible. But the reality? It’s just a lot of hot air. Kind of like Alfoy bragging about drinking everyone under the table when he barely lasted a night.” “...” “Hero? Saintess? If they’re the hero and saintess, I’m the demon king!” “...” The group finally realized that the “companions” mentioned in Astion’s writings referred to none other than the hero and saintess themselves. The pieces of the puzzle fell into place, but the image they formed was far from the grand, awe-inspiring tale they had imagined. Dark shrugged, his form flickering as he prepared to leave. “Anyway, I’m heading back now! A lot of time has already passed over there. The boss said he’ll be back soon, so stop worrying!” Belinda called out one last time, her tone anxious. “Is he really okay? Make sure you take good care of him!” “God, you’re naggy. Stop worrying already! He’s busy smashing everything in his way!” What exactly Ghislain was “smashing” was unclear, but if Dark said it was fine, they could only trust him. Dark’s form began to blur, his presence growing fainter as he returned through the gateway to the past. Before disappearing completely, Dark glanced at Julien and delivered a parting shot. “Hey, don’t act so high and mighty. A thousand years ago, you were a total pushover. If you knew how pathetic you were, you’d crawl into a hole and cry.” “...” Julien, blindsided by the insult, didn’t respond. As always, he remained stoic, though a vein twitched on his forehead. “Still, it’s kind of freaky. You have the same name and face. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but reincarnation seems more likely. Anyway, I’m really leaving now. See you later!” With that, Dark vanished entirely, leaving behind a stunned silence. The room remained quiet for a long moment, the weight of everything they had heard settling in. Jerome’s hypothesis now seemed undeniable. Claude broke the silence, muttering with a mix of frustration and disbelief. “Why is it that every time something crazy happens, it’s always because of him?” For someone who prided himself on being the realm’s most logical mind, Claude felt like the universe was playing an elaborate joke on him. Belinda and Gillian felt their faces brighten with relief. Of course, it wasn’t as though all their worries had vanished—they had merely lessened compared to before. The calmest person in the room was Julien. “...I knew he’d handle it on his own.” Julienhad always trusted Ghislain’s abilities more than anyone. He had unwavering faith in Ghislain’s decisions and had never once opposed his actions. Even though Julien was confident there wouldn’t be any major issues, learning about the situation left him with an odd feeling. It was something beyond imagination. He recalled the first time he had met Ghislain. Unconsciously, he felt a mix of longing and familiarity. It was strange because it had been their first meeting. “...Was that why?” Based on Dark’s words, the hero from a thousand years ago apparently looked just like him. Was it possible he was the reincarnation of that hero? Could that explain the feelings he’d had upon meeting Ghislain for the first time? While it seemed plausible, Julien still wasn’t entirely convinced. The room fell into an awkward silence for a moment. The idea of Ghislain training the legendary hero and saintess was too absurd to fully process. Jerome broke the silence with a chuckle. “Haha, it’s quite an incredible story, isn’t it?” Vanessa nodded in agreement. As a mage, she couldn’t help but feel a deep curiosity about the current situation. “It’s a relief His Grace is safe. I hope he returns soon. It feels like we’re going to hear some fascinating stories.” While it was now evident that the past and the present were influencing each other, the exact extent and nature of this interaction were still unknown. Nonetheless, this was undoubtedly an event that could make waves in academia. For Vanessa, it was only natural to feel a desire to study the phenomenon. Claude glanced at Julien and spoke with a sly grin. “By the way... Julien, you must have been quite different a thousand years ago. To get called a pushover?” “...” Everyone turned to look at Julien. His expression remained as impassive as ever. A man who didn’t flinch even when struck—one of the strongest on the continent, and a rival to Ghislain—being called a pushover? It felt incongruous. Perhaps the hero merely shared his face and name, nothing more. Claude seized the moment, grinning mischievously. “Julien, you shouldn’t act all cool anymore!” “...” The others clicked their tongues in exasperation at Claude. Telling Julien not to act cool was absurd. The man didn’t try to be cool—he simply was. While Ghislain was charismatic and popular, Julien exuded an aura of mystery that far surpassed him. If there were ever a popularity contest, Julien would undoubtedly take first place. That was indisputable. Of course, Belinda and Gillian would vote for Ghislain with all their might. Jerome smiled and clapped his hands. “Well, then, while Ghislain is away, let’s focus on our responsibilities. If things aren’t in order when he returns, he’ll throw a fit.” There was still much to be done—managing the post-war reconstruction, suppressing the remnants of the Opposer’s followers, and researching ways to contain the expanding rifts. With a bit of relief settling in, some even exchanged lighthearted jokes. It was then that Julien spoke abruptly. “What? Where? Why?” Belinda was visibly startled. Ghislain had personally brought Julien to the estate, entrusting Belinda to look after him. The idea of him suddenly leaving was unexpected and worrying. Julien glanced briefly at Ghislain, still lying peacefully, before speaking. “Now that I know he’s safe, there’s no reason for me to stay. I’m going to look for Gatros.” Julien had long sought Gatros, following a persistent hunch that he needed to find him. When Ghislain collapsed, Julien’s faith in his instincts wavered, and he stayed put, waiting for Ghislain to recover. But now, with nothing holding him back, he felt it was time to act. “Capturing Gatros might provide more information about the Opposer. And if we can also catch the runaway Duke Delphine, all the better.” “Our trackers are already scouring the continent,” Belinda argued. “I’ll act independently. I’ll find him and return as soon as possible.” When Julien made a decision, no one could stop him. The fact that he promised to return suggested that he’d grown fond of Fenris Estate. Belinda, reluctant to see him go, offered to send guards with him, but Julien refused. He packed only the bare necessities, mounted his horse, and rode off without hesitation. Watching him leave, Jerome shook his head in awe. “He’s so cool. It’s like he’s not even human.” Julien’s decisiveness reminded everyone of Ghislain. Even after Julien’s departure, the group engaged in heated discussions about Dark’s revelations. It was an extraordinary and mysterious situation, leaving no shortage of topics to debate. Julien being the reincarnation of the hero now carried more weight than before—it seemed plausible. The fact that the hero had met Ghislain a thousand years ago was fascinating. The idea that their bond had lasted this long was even more astonishing. Still, as plausible as it seemed, it was all just speculation and hypothesis. Until Ghislain returned, they couldn’t confirm anything. So, they waited, hoping for his safe and swift return. *** Over two years in Nodehill, Ghislain’s group had made significant changes to their base of operations. They had moved out of the estate provided by the lord and into a much larger building—a facility Ghislain himself had designed and built. The structure was equipped with training grounds and a variety of amenities, ensuring they could continue their training uninterrupted. Money wasn’t an issue. Leo’s funds were seemingly endless. In the center hall of the building was a large table surrounded by chairs, used for meetings and planning. Ghislain sat at the head of the table, resting his chin on his hand, his eyes closed. He looked quite different from before. His previously gaunt, slightly pudgy frame had transformed into a lean, muscular physique. His attire had changed, too—gone was his typical robe. Instead, he wore a tailored outfit of fine materials, with black-and-gold fur draped over his shoulders. The image he projected was one of authority and strength. He could have been mistaken for a high-ranking noble—or even a king of brigands. The sound of footsteps echoed through the hall as someone entered. The newcomer was a scruffy-looking man, his demeanor reminiscent of a negotiator or fixer. The man hesitated before speaking, clearly intimidated by Ghislain. “Um… Vice Leader…” “...Watch your tone.” “Ah, sorry! Deputy Commander! The Commander said everything’s ready.” Ghislain opened his eyes at last. Reaching for the long black staff leaning against his chair, he rose. The staff was heavy and solid, exuding an aura of power. Ghislain smiled as he held the weapon. “Well, then, let’s get moving.”
