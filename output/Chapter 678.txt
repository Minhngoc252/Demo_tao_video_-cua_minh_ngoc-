An awkward silence lingered for a moment. His body was still here, yet his consciousness had traveled to the past? How could that even make sense? Claude, who prided himself on being one of the most rational people in the estate, frowned and asked incredulously. “Jerome?” “Yes?” “You’re one of the few intellectuals in this estate alongside me.” “...” “Do you seriously think what you’re saying makes sense?” Jerome nodded firmly, his expression unyielding. “I understand how difficult this is to believe, but as of now, it’s the most credible hypothesis. Ghislain’s consciousness has indeed traveled to the past. Specifically... to meet the saintess from a thousand years ago and her companions.” Jerome’s demeanor made it clear that he truly believed this. Belinda’s voice trembled as she pressed further. “Uh… I think we need a more detailed explanation here.” “As you all know, the saintess said she would meet Ghislain again. If that statement is to come true...” Jerome calmly explained his hypothesis. Fortunately, since Ghislain had spoken extensively about his dreams in the past, everyone was able to follow along without too much difficulty. The theory made sense. If Jerome’s hypothesis was correct, it would explain everything happening now. But a hypothesis was just that—a theory, not a certainty. How could they be sure it was true? Vanessa, who had been quietly listening, finally spoke up. “Even if that’s true… how could he meet the saintess if only his consciousness traveled to the past?” That question was one Claude had been pondering as well. However, he believed he now had the answer. “Possession.” “Possession?” Everyone wore a dubious expression. Possession? Who even believed in such things? Jerome continued to speak confidently. “Ghislain must have possessed the body of our mage tower’s founder. As one of the hero’s companions.” “...” “In other words, the mage from a thousand years ago, the hero’s companion... was actually Ghislain!” “Wow...” Claude exclaimed sarcastically, his expression dripping with mockery. Jerome felt a twinge of embarrassment. The others also seemed at a loss for words. The story was becoming increasingly difficult to believe. Claude smirked and delivered a pointed remark. “Do you know the most important element of a good con?” “What is it?” “It needs to sound plausible.” “...” “Possession? Seriously? If you keep molding the hypothesis to fit the situation, nothing will ever make sense!” As if expecting such a rebuttal, Jerome pulled a book from his robes. “It’s all written here.” “And what is that?” “A record written personally by the founder of the mage tower.” Belinda tilted her head in confusion. “...That exists? Weren’t all records from a thousand years ago lost?” Wasn’t that why they could never definitively identify the Opposer? Jerome, looking slightly troubled, responded. “You’re correct. I had never seen this before either. This book wasn’t in the tower until recently.” “So... it just appeared out of nowhere?” “Yes... as unbelievable as it sounds...” “...” The room fell silent again. Who could believe such a story? It was more plausible to think Jerome simply hadn’t noticed the book earlier. Jerome, looking visibly frustrated, pounded his chest. “I swear it’s true! I’ve read every book in the mage tower. I have no idea why I never saw this one before!” His indignation was palpable. Vanessa, ever composed, spoke in a soothing tone. “Alright. Let’s assume that’s the case.” “It’s not an assumption—it’s the truth!” “Fine, I believe you. So this book is your proof?” “Yes! The founder wrote down his experiences in it!” Jerome opened the book. The opening lines were visible even from a distance. Only Claude leaned in closer to read the text. I am Astion, named after the great Dragon Lord Astrion and the founder of the Tower of Radiance. Following the advice of a dear friend, I have decided to record the events I experienced in this book. Born with a mysterious constitution, I have been able to harbor the consciousnesses of others within my body since childhood. From them, I gained vast knowledge and rapidly grew stronger as a mage. The foundation for my friends’ strength was built upon what those consciousnesses shared. Afterward, we embarked on a journey together... The content was fascinating. If the book were authentic, it would prove that possession was a real phenomenon. It detailed how Astion, a rural mage, began his journey with friends and chronicled their adventures. ...One day, while rescuing villagers captured by bandits, I encountered another possessing spirit. Initially, it was no different from the others I had hosted, but this one was unlike any before. At some point, everyone fell silent, absorbed in the text. Their breathing grew heavier as they continued reading. I was forcibly displaced from my body. The possessing spirit was incredibly powerful. Its consciousness surpassed that of any mortal, and it carried an abundance of mysterious knowledge. It introduced itself as follows: Belinda unconsciously read the next line aloud. “The Grand Duke of Ruthania and the King of Mercenaries...” Her voice faltered, unable to finish the sentence. Jerome, unable to hold back, declared the name. “Ghislain Fenris.” “...” Everyone exchanged bewildered looks. Why was Ghislain’s name written in a record supposedly from a thousand years ago? Claude shot to his feet, pointing a finger at Jerome. “This is absurd! Did you make this up? Did you forge it just to validate your ridiculous hypothesis?” It sounded far more plausible than the claim that the book was authentic. Jerome was instantly branded a fraud. Jerome shouted desperately. “I didn’t make it up! I swear, this was already written in the book!” “A book that conveniently appears out of nowhere, containing records of past events and even our lord’s name? It’s too convenient! This doesn’t make sense!” “I know it doesn’t make sense! I’m losing my mind over it too!” Belinda intervened, trying to mediate between the two. “What’s written next? Let’s focus on that first!” When Jerome turned the page, a new section began. Thanks to Ghislain, our companions quickly grew stronger. I don’t know why, but Ghislain taught us so much and pushed us through brutal training. His methods were nothing short of… demonic. The text detailed how Ghislain had trained and, to some extent, tormented his companions. It described how he recklessly took over territories, claimed treasures, and did whatever he pleased—all while eliciting a mix of grudging admiration and exasperation from those around him. Belinda couldn’t help but mutter to herself as she read the description. “That really does sound like him.” Everyone nodded in unison. The more they read, the more it seemed like the writing perfectly captured Ghislain’s character. Ghislain wasn’t merely a once-in-a-millennium talent—he was someone who probably should only be born once in a thousand years to spare others the trouble. A personality like his was almost impossible to replicate. Yet, even with the matching descriptions, people couldn’t fully accept it as truth. After all, such things could easily be fabricated. Jerome, knowing Ghislain as well as he did, had to admit the personality depicted was eerily accurate. It was as if someone had carefully documented Ghislain’s antics down to the last detail. Claude, suspicious as ever, narrowed his eyes and asked, “So, this book claims our lord did all these things? What else does it say? Surely, there’s more to the story.” Everyone’s curiosity turned toward what might lie ahead. They wanted to know what had happened in the past—who the real enemy was, what Ghislain had achieved, and what secrets he had uncovered. Jerome flipped the page nervously. “...” There was nothing written. The last entry detailed how Ghislain had seized a gold mine and ruthlessly trained his companions, and then… it simply stopped. Claude slammed his hand down on the table, pointing accusingly at Jerome. “See? That’s it! You couldn’t make up more, could you? Ran out of ideas, didn’t you? This is all just some poorly planned hoax!” Jerome’s face turned pale as Claude’s words hit home. He raised his hands defensively. “It’s not a hoax! I swear I didn’t fabricate this!” Claude sneered. “Sure. And I’m supposed to believe this ‘Astion’ fellow is even real? How convenient that no one can confirm anything about him.” Belinda sighed and intervened again. “What about this Astion? Do we even know if he’s the founder of the mage tower?” Jerome hesitated. “Well, to be honest… I just learned his name myself. The founder’s name was never passed down properly.” Claude scoffed. “So let me get this straight—according to your theory, Ghislain possessed this Astion’s body. Is that right?” “Yes.” “And this Astion was supposedly a mage, right? One who performed all kinds of magic in the past?” “Yes.” Claude crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. “Then tell me this: how could Ghislain, of all people, know how to use magic?” “...” Jerome faltered. He hadn’t considered that angle. Belinda, however, instantly came to Ghislain’s defense. “Our lord is brilliant! He could’ve learned it easily if he wanted to!” Claude rolled his eyes. “Oh, come on. Magic isn’t something you just pick up in a day. If that were the case, I’d be a mage too! And I’m the smartest person here!” “...” Jerome had no answer to that. Belinda fumed. “Our lord is both brilliant and capable. If he set his mind to it, he could do anything!” Claude shot back. “No one’s denying his capability, but magic is a completely different field! It’s not just about intelligence!” The two began bickering, while the others exchanged skeptical looks. Vanessa cleared her throat, trying to redirect the conversation. “Regardless of whether he could use magic or not, what matters is that Jerome’s theory holds some weight. If Ghislain really went to the past, there must be a reason for it. Perhaps the saintess summoned him to reveal something important.” Jerome nodded in agreement. “That’s exactly what I believe. The saintess may have needed his help for something, or perhaps she wanted to share a critical secret with him.” “But if he’s in the past, doesn’t that mean the outcome is already decided? Whatever he does, the present won’t change.” The room fell silent as that thought sank in. Indeed, the future was already written. They had defeated the Opposer and brought peace to the continent. No matter what Ghislain did in the past, it wouldn’t alter the present. The more they tried to piece it together, the murkier things became. There were too many unanswered questions. Jerome sighed. “For now, I’ll continue studying this book and see if I can find any more clues. There has to be a reason why it stops so abruptly.” The others nodded reluctantly, knowing there was little else they could do. Just as they were preparing to leave, a commotion erupted outside. “Bang!” A knight who had been guarding Ghislain’s quarters burst into the room, shouting. “Dark! Dark has appeared! He’s demanding to speak with the administrator or the steward immediately—” Before the knight could finish, everyone sprang into action. “What’s going on?” In their haste, they nearly knocked over walls as they rushed toward the scene. Claude, however, was left behind, shouting after them as he clung to Wendy’s back. “Wait for me!”
