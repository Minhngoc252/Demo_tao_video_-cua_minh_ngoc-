At Baron Shear’s words, Ghislain gave a faint smile. “When is it happening?” “In a month. The negotiation will take place on the Heine Plains, where the ‘item’ will be exchanged.” Rumors had already spread about an exchange happening during the negotiations. While the exact nature of the item remained unclear, it was known enough for officials to prepare accordingly, ensuring they weren’t caught off guard. “They put a lot of thought into choosing the location.” Ghislain was well-acquainted with the Heine Plains. It was near the southern front, devoid of any forests or hills where one could hide—nothing but an open expanse. It was a barren plain. If both sides brought their agreed-upon 50,000 troops to meet face-to-face, it would be nearly impossible for either side to pull off a sneak attack. Baron Shear nodded in agreement. “Yes. Both sides are maintaining constant reconnaissance to ensure that only the promised troops are brought. They’re being very thorough.” “Quite cautious.” “This negotiation seems to be of utmost importance to both parties.” If the main focus was simply a truce negotiation, there wouldn’t be a need for such extreme caution. At this point, it was clear even to outsiders that the exchange of the mysterious ‘item’ was the true objective. Baron Shear continued cautiously. “The Royal Army will depart in a week. Given the distance, they need the time. I plan to leave in three days, under the pretense of assessing the situation, but really to get away. Are you sure about this?” A total of 100,000 troops were expected to gather on that vast plain. No matter how skilled Ghislain was, stealing the item and escaping seemed nearly impossible. Moreover, the Royal Swordmaster and the Captain of the Royal Knights would be present. Whether Ghislain could even seize the item in the first place was doubtful. But Ghislain replied with a casual expression, as if it were no big deal. “Well… it won’t be easy, but I’ll figure out a way to take it and get out.” Baron Shear gave him a look of disbelief and spoke honestly. “If you fail, Count, I’ll flee to another kingdom immediately.” Trust didn’t come easy, but the stakes were high enough to take the risk. Staying in the capital under the rule of a mad king was terrifying, and there wasn’t much to hold Shear back. Judging by Count Fenris’s past feats, it somehow felt like he would succeed again. Ghislain chuckled and nodded. “Do that. I’ll assign knights to escort you to Fenris Territory.” Ghislain planned to send word to Dark to arrange for knights to escort Shear a week later. After confirming Shear’s destination, Ghislain asked, “Any other unusual details?” “His Majesty plans to attend in person.” “Is that so?” “Yes, everyone tried to dissuade him, but he wouldn’t listen. It seems he wants to verify the item himself.” “Makes sense.” Ghislain had a good idea why. The king desired a solution to his own failing health, and whatever the Salvation Order was offering would supposedly provide that solution. Naturally, the king needed to see it for himself. If the item wasn’t what he expected, the consequences would be disastrous. Having delivered the information, Baron Shear rose to his feet. “Well then, I’ll take my leave. I wish you success.” “Yes, travel safely. I’ll see you again in the territory.” Shear couldn’t help but smile at Ghislain’s confident tone. That unshakable self-assurance—where did it come from? It was both enviable and exasperating. Just as Baron Shear was about to leave, he paused and asked, “Aren’t you going to visit the Marquis of Branford before you go?” Truthfully, there wasn’t much benefit in meeting the marquis. Despite the Northern Army becoming an enemy of the royal family, the Marquis of Branford remained untouched. This was due to the nature of the king and nobles—they wouldn’t act rashly. The Northern Army and many regional lords still pledged allegiance to the Marquis. Taking him hostage or harming him would risk sparking a large-scale rebellion, so they preferred to bide their time until they had complete control. But if someone discovered a deeper relationship between the Marquis and Ghislain beyond a political alliance, it could lead to the Marquis being taken as a hostage or used for leverage. Even so, Ghislain smiled casually. “Well, since I’m here, I might as well pay him a visit. I’m sure he must feel quite lonely now that he’s withdrawn from politics.” Ghislain understood the risks but didn’t seem to care. As long as he wasn’t caught, it didn’t matter. Baron Shear laughed. Ghislain’s confidence and composure truly were unmatched. “Very well. I’ll see you again after your success.” After Baron Shear left, Ghislain returned to the celebration. While the other soldiers indulged in drinks and food, Ghislain remained sober. With the time and location for the negotiations set, he needed to start making preparations. ‘Dark, it’s time. I’ll send you the details, so get ready.’ ― Got it! In the dark of night, an unseen crow flew into the sky, carrying Ghislain’s message to the waiting Northern Army. The next day, Ghislain used his reward to take leave and headed straight for the Branford Marquis’s mansion. “Hmm, I’ll have to slip in unnoticed… Can I manage it?” He had frequented the mansion in the past and knew the blind spots in the guards’ patrols. But avoiding magical detection and the knights’ heightened senses would be difficult. Noble estates like the Branford mansion were fortified with enchantments designed to prevent even superhumans from sneaking in unnoticed. The entire space was under surveillance, so even Ghislain wasn’t guaranteed to get through undetected. “In that case… the front door is the best option.” With a smirk, Ghislain confidently walked toward the mansion’s main gate. Among the guards stationed there, one caught his attention, and Ghislain chuckled to himself. “Still working here, huh?” It was the same guard who had once tried to keep Ghislain from entering. He yawned as he stood on duty. It seemed the job had treated him well enough to keep him around for so long. “I suppose staying here is safer than joining another army these days.” Ignoring the other guards, Ghislain approached the one he recognized and spoke. “Hey, the marquis is home, right? Don’t bother denying it—I’ve already checked.” The guard frowned. Something about the words sounded familiar, like something he’d heard before. “Who are you?” Ghislain was dressed in plain civilian clothes, and his face was different from his usual appearance. He looked like a commoner through and through. The guard scowled. This wasn’t a place for random commoners to come and go freely. Still, he answered stiffly, as protocol required. “You’ll need to leave your name and purpose in the guest log. Someone will contact you later to arrange a meeting.” Ghislain couldn’t help but laugh. The guard hadn’t changed at all. He placed a hand on the guard’s shoulder and turned him slightly to avoid being seen by others. “It’s me.” When Ghislain reverted to his true appearance, the guard’s eyes widened in shock. “Wait, you’re—!” Before the guard could cry out, Ghislain quickly covered his mouth and returned to his disguised face. “Shh. No need to make a scene, right? You’ll let me in, won’t you?” The guard nodded frantically. He wasn’t foolish enough to cause trouble here. “F-Follow me.” When the other guards noticed the sudden change in demeanor, they asked suspiciously, “Hey, who is this? Why are you letting him in so easily?” “You can’t just let anyone in, you know.” The first guard snapped irritably, “I know him! The butler sent for him!” The guard improvised, using the butler’s authority as a shield. Reluctantly, the other guards backed off, though they still looked uneasy. “Fine, but hurry it up. The butler’s waiting, right?” The guard quickly escorted Ghislain inside, his nerves on edge. Ghislain offered a faint smile at Baron Shear's words. "When is it?" "In a month. The negotiation will take place on the Heine Plains, and the ‘item’ will be exchanged there." Rumors about an exchange during the negotiation had already spread widely. While no one knew exactly what the item was, its exchange was common knowledge. Officials needed to be aware to prepare and avoid being blindsided. "They’ve clearly put some thought into this." The Heine Plains were a location Ghislain knew well. Situated near the southern front, the area had no forests or hills to serve as hiding places—just an open, barren expanse. It was the perfect flatland. If both sides brought 50,000 troops each to meet face-to-face, any attempt at ambush would be extremely difficult. Baron Shear nodded in agreement. "Yes. Both sides are maintaining constant reconnaissance to ensure only the agreed-upon forces are brought. They’re leaving nothing to chance." "Very cautious." "This negotiation appears to be of great importance to both sides." If the truce was the main goal, such precautions would seem excessive. By now, even outsiders could guess that the mysterious ‘item’ being exchanged was the true purpose of the meeting. Baron Shear spoke carefully. "The Royal Army will leave in a week. The distance requires it. I plan to leave in three days under the pretense of assessing the situation but in reality to flee. Are you sure about this?" A total of 100,000 soldiers were set to gather on the Heine Plains. No matter how skilled Ghislain was, stealing the item and escaping seemed nearly impossible. The Royal Swordmaster and the Captain of the Royal Knights would be present as well. Whether Ghislain could even seize the item was in question. However, Ghislain responded with a casual expression, as though it were nothing. "Well… it won’t be easy, but I’ll figure out a way to grab it and get out." Baron Shear gave him a look of disbelief and spoke bluntly. "If you fail, Count, I’ll flee to another kingdom immediately." It wasn’t that Shear had much faith in him, but the stakes were too high to ignore. Staying in the capital under the rule of a mad king was terrifying, and Shear had little attachment left. Judging by everything Count Fenris had achieved so far, there was a certain feeling that he might succeed again. Ghislain chuckled, nodding. "Do that. I’ll arrange for knights to escort you to Fenris Territory." Ghislain planned to send word through Dark, arranging for the knights to escort Shear a week later. After confirming Shear’s destination, Ghislain asked, "Any other notable details?" "His Majesty is attending personally." "Really?" "Yes. Everyone tried to dissuade him, but he wouldn’t listen. It seems he wants to verify the item himself." "Makes sense." Ghislain had a good idea why. The king was desperate for a solution to his declining health, and the item from the Salvation Order likely promised exactly that. Naturally, the king had to see it for himself. If it turned out to be something else, the consequences would be disastrous. Having delivered the information, Baron Shear rose to leave. "I’ll take my leave then. I wish you success." "Yes. Travel safely. I’ll see you at the territory." Shear couldn’t help but smile at Ghislain’s confidence. Where did that unwavering self-assurance come from? It was both enviable and bewildering. As Shear reached the door, he paused and turned. "Aren’t you going to visit Marquis Branford before you leave?" There wasn’t much benefit in meeting him. Despite the Northern Army becoming an enemy of the royal family, the Marquis of Branford remained untouched. This was due to the nature of the king and the nobles—they preferred caution. Many lords and nobles across the kingdom still pledged allegiance to the marquis. Taking him hostage or harming him would risk sparking a widespread rebellion. For now, the strategy was to leave him be until the rest of the opposition was subdued. However, if someone discovered a deeper relationship between Ghislain and the marquis beyond political alignment, the royal family might decide to take the marquis hostage for leverage. "Well, since I’m here, I might as well pay my respects. I imagine he’s feeling quite lonely, having withdrawn from politics." Ghislain was aware of the risks but didn’t seem to care. As long as he didn’t get caught, it didn’t matter. Baron Shear simply laughed. Ghislain’s confidence and composure were truly unmatched. "Very well. I’ll see you again after your success." After Shear left, Ghislain returned to the celebration. While the soldiers indulged in food and drink, Ghislain remained sober. With the negotiation’s time and location set, there was no time to waste. "Dark, it’s time to start. I’ll send you the location—make the preparations." ― Got it! In the dark night sky, a crow flew unnoticed, carrying Ghislain’s message to the waiting Northern Army. The next day, Ghislain used his reward to leave the camp and headed straight for Marquis Branford’s mansion. "Hmm, I’ll need to get in unnoticed… Can I manage it?" He had frequented the mansion enough to memorize the guards’ blind spots. However, avoiding magical detection and the knights’ heightened senses was a different matter entirely. A noble of Marquis Branford’s stature fortified his estate with enchantments that even superhumans would struggle to bypass undetected. "In that case… going through the front door is probably the best option." With a smirk, Ghislain approached the mansion’s main gate confidently. Among the guards, one caught his eye, and Ghislain let out a quiet chuckle. "Still here, huh?" It was the same guard who had once tried to stop him from entering. He yawned at his post, seemingly enjoying stable employment. "Given the current climate, staying with the marquis does seem like the safer choice." Ignoring the other guards, Ghislain approached the one he recognized. "Hey, the marquis is home, right? Don’t bother denying it—I’ve already checked." The guard frowned. The words sounded oddly familiar, as if he’d heard them before. "Who are you?" Ghislain, dressed in plain clothes and wearing a different face, looked every bit the commoner. The guard’s brows furrowed. This wasn’t a place where just anyone could wander in. Still, protocol demanded he respond. "If you leave your name and purpose in the guest log, someone will reach out later to schedule a meeting—" Ghislain couldn’t help but laugh. "You’re as predictable as ever." He placed a hand on the guard’s shoulder and turned him slightly, away from the view of others. "It’s me." As Ghislain returned to his original appearance, the guard tilted his head in confusion before his eyes widened in shock. "W-Wait, you’re—!" Before the guard could shout, Ghislain quickly covered his mouth and shifted back to his disguise, whispering with a grin. "Shh. No need for others to know. You’ll let me in, right?" The guard nodded rapidly. Only a fool would make a scene here, and he wasn’t one. "F-Follow me." The other guards noticed the abrupt change in the guard’s behavior and spoke up suspiciously. "Hey, what’s going on? Who is that?" "You can’t just let someone in without checking!" As they moved to block the way, the nervous guard snapped back. "I know him! The butler called for him!" He improvised on the spot, using the butler as a convenient excuse. After all, mentioning the marquis’s name would draw unnecessary attention. Reluctantly, the other guards backed off, though they still exchanged uneasy glances. "Fine, but hurry it up. The butler’s waiting, right?" The guard quickly led Ghislain into the estate. It was rare for a mere guard to have direct access to the Marquis of Branford. Normally, there were layers of procedures and protocols to follow for such a meeting. However, the butler was different. As one of the few people with the authority to report directly to the marquis, he could facilitate the meeting. The guard brought Ghislain straight to the butler and spoke in a low, urgent voice. "It’s Count Fenris." "What???" The butler’s eyes widened in disbelief as he turned to face Ghislain. Ghislain smiled and revealed his true face again. "Hello. It’s been a while." The butler’s jaw tightened as he processed what was happening. "This… is unexpected." Regaining his composure, the butler quickly addressed the soldiers stationed outside the room. "Clear the area. We have an important guest, and I require privacy for our discussion." The soldiers, though puzzled, obeyed the butler’s command without hesitation. The guard who had brought Ghislain seemed unsure of what to do next, his gaze darting nervously around the room. The butler turned to him and spoke firmly. "You are relieved of all duties for the time being. A room will be prepared for you to rest in, and you are to remain there until further notice. Do you understand? Rest assured, you’ll be compensated handsomely." The guard nodded eagerly, his relief palpable as the butler handed him a small pouch of gold coins. After the guard was dismissed, the butler turned back to Ghislain, his expression a mixture of astonishment and curiosity. "How did you manage to get here?" "I came to see the marquis," Ghislain replied casually. "I thought I’d stop by to pay my respects." The butler let out a heavy sigh. "You always did have nerves of steel, Count." While the Northern Army had not formally declared rebellion, their defiance of the king’s orders was tantamount to treason. The current sentiment toward the Northern Army was overwhelmingly hostile. Rumors were already circulating that the royal family, in alliance with the Duke’s faction, was preparing to launch an attack against them. And yet, here was Ghislain, boldly walking into the capital to visit the Marquis of Branford. The butler could only shake his head in amazement. "Follow me. I’ll take you to the marquis." The butler led Ghislain through the estate, dismissing the knights and soldiers stationed near the marquis’s study. While some were puzzled by the sudden orders, they complied without question. After all, the marquis’s chief knight, Captain Tolreo, was already present inside. The butler entered first, his tone cautious. "Marquis, you have a guest." The Marquis of Branford looked up from the book he had been reading. His face was noticeably thinner, and his once-commanding presence had dimmed, replaced by an air of weariness. Seeing his frail state, Ghislain felt a twinge of sympathy as he smiled faintly. "How have you been?" The marquis narrowed his eyes, studying Ghislain. "And who might you be?" Ghislain revealed his original face once more. The marquis’s eyes widened in shock, as did those of Captain Tolreo, who was seated nearby. "You… How on earth did you…?" "I’m in the capital for a short while," Ghislain said with a relaxed demeanor. "I thought I’d stop by to say hello." The marquis let out a dry laugh, shaking his head in disbelief. "You’ve always had a way of defying expectations, Fenris." The Marquis of Branford let out a hearty laugh at Ghislain’s reply. No matter how many times he interacted with him, Ghislain was always a fascinating character. To come alone to the capital and visit him in such circumstances—truly, this man was remarkable. "Bring some tea. I must enjoy a chat with an old friend," the marquis instructed. The butler soon returned with tea, placing it on the table before them. However, once seated, the two exchanged little more than pleasantries, inquiring about each other's well-being and exchanging idle chatter. After spending some time like this, Ghislain rose from his seat. "I’ll take my leave now. Seeing that you’re safe is enough for me." The marquis looked up. "Will you be seeing Maurice as well?" Ghislain shook his head. "No, I’ll meet him later. If he starts insisting we drink together, the rumors will spread in no time. I only have today, so I’ll see everyone else another time." This was his only opportunity to leave camp, and he couldn’t afford to visit all his acquaintances. With an important mission ahead, he needed to be discreet. The marquis posed another question. "And Rosalyn?" Ghislain hesitated for a moment before shaking his head again. "Hmm… I’ll see her later as well. I don’t want to cause her any unnecessary turmoil." The marquis let out a dry chuckle. As a father, Ghislain’s dismissive attitude toward his daughter was infuriating. Still, his expression soon grew solemn as he asked, "So, have you made your decision?" "I decided the moment I heard the news," Ghislain replied firmly. "That’s just like you." The marquis nodded, a faint smile on his face. He had anticipated this outcome. Though it left him unsettled, he knew it was not something he could stop. Those who had led the kingdom until now had to step aside—it was simply time. After a moment of contemplation, the marquis fixed his gaze on Ghislain. "Ghislain." "Yes, my lord?" "I entrust the kingdom to you." For a man who had always prioritized the royal family above all else, this was a profound statement. Now, he was placing his trust not in the monarchy, but in the future of the kingdom itself. Everyone in the room understood the gravity of his words. Ghislain had little personal investment in the future of the kingdom. His sole concern was eliminating the Duke’s faction and protecting Ferdium and Fenris. But the situation had changed. To achieve his goals, he would need to dismantle the royal family. The one who deposed the king would inevitably bear the responsibility of leading the kingdom forward. This was the marquis’s final wish—to entrust the kingdom to Ghislain, not for the sake of the royal family, but for the kingdom’s survival and prosperity. After a long silence, Ghislain bowed deeply. "Thank you for everything, Marquis." Though it had been Ghislain who first approached him, it was the Marquis of Branford who had recognized his potential and offered unwavering support. That was no small feat. It required both the discernment to recognize talent and the courage to back it wholeheartedly. Ghislain was genuinely grateful to him. Without the marquis and the nobles who followed him, Ghislain’s rise would not have been as swift. For that reason, Ghislain was determined to fulfill the marquis’s final wish. When Ghislain slowly raised his head, his eyes gleamed with a predatory ferocity, like a beast ready to strike. "It won’t take long."
