Not long after the envoy from Marquis Falkenheim departed, new information arrived. “Oh, we finally got a response. Count Swipel has invited us to a victory banquet at Crest’s lord’s castle. He says we should finalize the distribution of territory there.” Andrew handed Ghislain the letter from Count Swipel. After months of excuses, Swipel had finally sent a reply, long after the war had ended. Amusingly enough, Count Swipel had already seized control of all key locations within Crest’s territory. He had only reached out after securing the lord’s castle itself. By this point, Andrew and Leo couldn’t help but feel uneasy. “He waited until he occupied the entire region before contacting us? Why would he do that?” “Could he be trying to claim everything for himself?” “That wouldn’t even work…” Unless he was willing to fight the Julien Mercenaries, there was no way for Swipel to fully take over Crest’s territory. But fighting them was beyond his means. Even without the mercenaries, Nodehill and Rask had grown stronger after taking in prisoners. Swipel was already outmatched. Yet, despite that, he had taken all key locations and only then reached out. It was hard not to be suspicious. “Leo… Could the Count have found another way to claim Crest’s lands?” At Andrew’s question, Ghislain nodded. “He must have found a way to deal with us.” “Hmph, if it comes to a fight, we’ll win, though.” “Exactly. He can’t challenge us in open battle anymore. So he must be planning something.” “What kind of scheme?” “He’ll likely receive knight reinforcements from Marquis Falkenheim. The plan is probably to assassinate the leadership during the banquet.” Andrew immediately grasped the situation and scowled. “That cowardly bastard! He’s lower than a damn duck!” He was already aware that Falkenheim’s men had approached the Julien Mercenaries, and he also knew that Ghislain had turned them down. And now, right after that, Count Swipel had invited them to discuss the division of land. It was too obvious. Just as Ghislain had pointed out, Swipel was likely scheming behind their backs. It was an obvious trap, but an annoying one to deal with. If they ignored the invitation, Swipel would just continue consolidating his control. “What should we do? We can’t go in person… Do we just abandon the territory?” “Why abandon it? Falkenheim is going to attack us sooner or later anyway.” He would march his troops in under the pretense of avenging his vassal. They could wait and fight then, but Ghislain preferred offense over defense. “It’s better to strike first and whittle down their forces. They’ll have sent elite knights. And while we’re at it, we should take care of Count Swipel as well.” “Hmph, wouldn’t it be better to raise our own forces first and warn him to surrender the land? If he refuses, then we go to war.” “That would take time and be a hassle. If we go now, he’ll pick a fight himself. Then we can just handle him right away.” “…Can we really pull that off?” Andrew asked the same question again. Ghislain’s methods always seemed reckless. But the truth was, they had worked every time. Ghislain grinned as always. “Of course. I don’t fight battles I can’t win.” If a fight seemed unwinnable, it was better to avoid it entirely. That was Ghislain’s philosophy. Andrew and Leo nodded firmly. They had no real choice in the matter. If the Julien Mercenaries fell, they were finished too. Their only option was to follow Ghislain and pray for victory. Ghislain turned to the other officers. “This time, we’re heading straight into enemy territory. Should be a good experience. Anyone scared?” Deneb promptly raised her hand. “…” Ghislain had nothing to say to that kind of honesty. It was only natural for Deneb to feel pressured given her current level. ‘She needs to awaken soon…’ If she did, no one would dare lay a hand on her. But there was still no clear method to make it happen, which frustrated him. Not that it changed his plans. “…Everyone else is fine, right?” Tyron glanced around nervously. Kyle did the same, and the two locked eyes. “Ahem. I’m not scared.” “Me neither… not at all.” Anyone could tell they were a little nervous. Both were among the strongest warriors in the region, but heading straight into an enemy stronghold filled with Falkenheim’s knights was daunting. Still, their pride wouldn’t let them back down. As the two steeled themselves, Julien calmly spoke. “If this is the best option, then we go.” “As expected of our leader.” Ghislain nodded approvingly. Julien was growing much faster than he had anticipated. Kyle and Tyron pouted, feeling like they’d been left behind. Osvald, who was also among the senior members, suddenly spoke up. “Boss, this manly Osvald… must visit his hometown for a long-overdue reunion with his parents.” “Alright then, so no one’s backing out. Let’s head straight to Swipel’s territory and end this.” With Ghislain’s words, everyone was dragged into the plan. Andrew and Leo also mobilized their troops. Count Swipel welcomed Ghislain’s group warmly. “Haha, welcome, welcome! I was swamped with responsibilities, so my invitation was delayed. Please, come in, enjoy the banquet, and let’s talk over the details.” The mercenaries and soldiers set up camp near the lord’s castle. With thousands of troops present, tents sprouted up everywhere. Swipel discreetly glanced at the Nodehill and Rask forces. ‘These fools… they’ve already absorbed the prisoners? Idiots. They only have more bodies now. No way they’re united.’ He sneered internally. Taking in prisoners was meaningless. After all, the enemy still had the larger force. If it came down to a battle, those prisoners would crumble quickly. All he had to do was eliminate the leaders, and the rest would surrender without a fight. ‘The prisoners will fall in line. Falkenheim is backing me up.’ He was confident. Today’s plan was bound to succeed. ‘But… why do they look so pissed off? Did something bad happen? This should be good news for me…’ There was a dangerous energy in the air. Their movements were sharp and decisive. It didn’t make sense for them to change so drastically in just a few days. That only made it more suspicious. ‘It’s almost like… they need an excuse to vent their frustration…?’ If they were already disgruntled, that was even better. They would be easier to manipulate. Swipel relaxed. As long as he eliminated the top brass, the troops would surrender without resistance. This meeting was meant to discuss post-war matters, but it was also a victory banquet. Even the waiting soldiers received food and drink. Just as they were about to enter, Andrew hesitated and spoke awkwardly. “I rushed over here, so I didn’t get to give my men some final orders. You go ahead first. I’ll join you soon.” Leo also wore an uneasy expression. “I feel the same way. I forgot to bring a gift for the Count. I’ll fetch it right away.” Before Count Swipel could say anything, Ghislain cut in. “Go ahead. The commander and I will go ahead and speak with the Count in the meantime.” Swipel chuckled at that. “Haha, take your time. The banquet is long. Shall we head in first?” And so, only Ghislain, Julien, and Kyle followed Count Swipel inside. Deneb and Tyron remained outside to oversee the mercenaries. The moment they stepped into the banquet hall, a strange atmosphere settled over them. Ghislain took in the sight of the people around him. They were all dressed in lavish attire, yet something felt off. Their expressions were stiff, and their eyes remained fixed solely on Ghislain’s group. Swipel wore a faint smile and spoke. “Haha, these are the neighboring nobles and military commanders. A banquet doesn’t feel right without enough people, wouldn’t you agree? So, I invited them.” “Is that so?” Ghislain smirked. If that was the case, then why did everyone seem so unnaturally tense? Even the servants guiding them and carrying food radiated sharp intent. The suffocating atmosphere lingered. In any normal banquet, people would be chatting and laughing, but there was none of that. Still, Swipel maintained his forced smile and gestured toward the table. “Come now, let’s have a drink. A little alcohol should loosen everyone up, no?” Everyone in the room lifted their glasses and took a drink. Everyone except for Ghislain’s group. Seeing this, Swipel chuckled playfully. “What’s the matter? Are you afraid it’s poisoned? Look, we’ve all had a sip.” Without a word, Ghislain tilted his glass. The liquor inside spilled onto the floor. Clatter. The sound of the glass shattering echoed through the banquet hall. Despite the number of people present, no other sound followed. The eerie stillness was almost unnatural. Ghislain stared at Swipel and spoke. “There’s no need to keep up the act.” “…” “Shall we skip straight to the main event? We already know what’s going on. Besides, even if I drank that pathetic excuse for poison, it wouldn’t do a damn thing to me.” “…Heh.” Swipel shook with laughter. To be fair, his scheme had been a little too obvious. What truly amused him, however, was the confidence of the fools who walked into his trap knowing full well what awaited them. Swipel leaned forward. “So, you knew you couldn’t escape and came in willingly?” “Well, why wouldn’t I? It’s an opportunity to take all of Count Swipel’s lands in one go.” “Hah! Did it never cross your mind that this entire event was set up to capture you?” Ghislain smirked. “That’s usually what people like you think. They assume they know our limits and prepare accordingly. You know what happens to those people?” “What happens?” Ghislain grinned and leaned forward slightly. “They all die.” “…” “If you’ve got more reinforcements, you’d better bring them in now. If this is all you’ve got, I’ll be disappointed.” Even with over fifty armed men in the hall, Ghislain made it sound like there weren’t enough. Swipel’s expression hardened. No matter how well-prepared he was, that unwavering confidence was unnerving. “Fine… let’s see how long you keep that attitude.” He raised his hand. Immediately, doors across the banquet hall swung open, and fully armed knights stormed in. They distributed swords, shields, and throwing spears to the attendees already present. So even the supposed nobles and officers had been knights in disguise. With the knights from both Marquis Falkenheim and Count Swipel combined, there were over a hundred men in the hall. A wave of oppressive killing intent flooded toward Ghislain, Julien, and Kyle. The knights sneered, as if they had already won. “There really are a lot of strong ones in this era.” Even at a glance, most of them were high-ranking knights. A few were at the pinnacle level. This was more than enough to take down a transcendent warrior. It was clear why they were so confident. Especially since Ghislain wasn’t even at full strength yet. But they had made one crucial miscalculation. “If you think I’m just any transcendent, you’re sorely mistaken.” Ghislain was beyond that level. He was someone who could bend reality through sheer will alone. Rumble… From within his body, his mana began to shift. The restructured mana formed artificial cores across his body. Rumble… As the first core activated, mana began flowing into it and rotating rapidly. It then surged into a second core, increasing its speed and intensity. By the time the third and final core formed, Ghislain’s mana output had skyrocketed. Although it wasn’t as refined as the natural core he had cultivated within his own body, his transcendental state compensated for any shortcomings. Boooom! A suffocating pressure exploded outward, overwhelming everyone in the hall. Even the one hundred knights who had confidently unleashed their own auras hesitated, instinctively stepping backward. Ghislain lowered his stance, baring a feral grin. “A hundred knights, huh…?” A crimson glow ignited in his eyes. “This is gonna be fun.”
