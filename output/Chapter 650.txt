Ghislain started a conversation with the three companions. He had many questions, but more importantly, he knew very little about this era. The three of them answered Ghislain’s questions readily. They still believed he was Astion, the eccentric wizard they had grown accustomed to. Astion’s strange behavior was nothing new to them, so they accepted it without much fuss. Listening to their answers, Ghislain’s face lit up with amusement. "So, the three of you are all from the same village?" Julien nodded. "Yeah, including you." "Hmm, and this wizard here has been claiming that other souls occasionally take over his body?" "That’s right. At first, we thought it was strange, but... now we sort of believe it." "Sort of believe? How does that even work?" "It’s hard to believe something so bizarre, but the results speak for themselves." Kyle chimed in from the side. "Yeah, Astion knows all sorts of weird stuff. Where would someone in a small village learn any of that? He even taught himself magic." Deneb nodded in agreement. "Astion’s the genius of our village. There’s nothing he doesn’t know. He said all of it came from the people who possessed him—ancient sages and knights." Ghislain muttered in fascination. "Wow, so you’re saying that’s a real ability? Hard to believe. How is something like that even possible?" Julien raised an eyebrow. "Aren’t you supposed to be from another time yourself?" Ghislain coughed awkwardly. "Ahem, well, yes. Anyway, all three of you are on a journey to grow stronger, right?" "Yeah," Julien replied. "Deneb’s here on a mission from the temple, but we asked her to join us." Ghislain nodded thoughtfully and continued his questions. "And the reason you want to grow stronger is to fight the Demonic Realm?" "Exactly. It’ll soon be the time when the Demonic Realm stirs again. We’re going to fight them and save the world," Julien declared, his eyes shining with determination. The conviction in his expression showed an unshakable belief that he would succeed. No hesitation, no doubt. Perhaps this was why he was destined to be called a Hero. Others might have laughed at such lofty dreams, dismissing them as childish fantasies. But Ghislain knew these three would eventually achieve their goals. And he also knew just how incredible their accomplishments would be. They weren’t just dreamers—they were humanity’s saviors. That title suited them far more than it ever could him. Ghislain chuckled. "It’s strange seeing someone talk like that with such sparkling eyes." Still, it was fitting. The Julien of his own time had also fought to save the world. Some people, it seemed, were simply born to play the role of Hero. With interest, Ghislain turned to Deneb and Kyle. "What about you two? Are you also trying to save the world?" Deneb nodded vigorously. "Of course. It’s my duty as a servant of the goddess." Kyle scratched his head. "I just want to get stronger." "Why?" "Why else? Being the strongest is the coolest." "Ah," Ghislain mused. "You’re a bit different from Kaor, but you remind me of him." Regardless of their motivations, all three shared a burning desire to grow stronger. Ghislain was already familiar with the Demonic Realm from what Ereneth had told him. The Salvation Order was known to harness its power, summoning beings from the rifts within. These events had occurred cyclically in the past. Judging by Julien’s words, it seemed the time was nearing for the Salvation Order to rise again. And this time, with the appearance of the Adversary, a great war loomed on the horizon. Knowing this, Ghislain nodded. "Alright, I’ll make you stronger. Just trust me. Feel free to ask me anything if you’re curious, and I’ll do the same." The three of them exchanged uncertain glances. They were used to Astion’s eccentricities, but this time he truly seemed like a different person. After a moment’s hesitation, Julien asked, "What happens to Astion then?" "Hmm... I don’t know." "Are you seriously someone else? You’re not just messing with us?" "I told you—I’m someone else." The three companions looked at each other, their expressions filled with concern. Their friend had suddenly vanished, replaced by a stranger. It was an unprecedented situation, and they didn’t know how to react. An awkward silence lingered until Ghislain broke it with a smile. "Don’t worry. Your friend Astion will be back soon enough. I’m only here temporarily. So let’s get along until then." "Leave?" Deneb asked. "Yes. So there’s no need to worry. I’m just here to see a few things." To Ghislain, the past wasn’t of great importance. These events had already occurred, and he didn’t think his presence here would drastically alter the future. At most, he would help them grow a little stronger. "Perhaps this meeting is why they came to know about me in the first place." It made sense why the wizard and Saintess would show him this dream. Perhaps it was a way to guide the future version of himself. Whether it was his suggestion or theirs didn’t matter. "That’s a question for later," Ghislain thought. For now, his priority was finding clues about the Adversary. He also intended to learn more about what had happened during this time. "Alright, let’s get moving. The journey to grow stronger starts now." "Where are we going?" Julien asked. Ghislain countered with his own question. "Are there any more bandit hideouts nearby?" "I’m not sure. We’d probably find one if we searched." "Good. Let’s start there." "Why?" "To make money, of course." "Huh? Are you planning to steal the bandits’ money? To help people?" Julien asked hesitantly. Ghislain chuckled. "Do you have a lot of money?" "...No." Ghislain turned to Deneb and Kyle. "What about you two? Are you rich?" Both shook their heads. Coming from a small village, none of them had much to their names. The trio’s appearance left much to be desired. They looked like drifters, with disheveled hair and clothes stained from travel. Frankly, they were filthy. Clicking his tongue, Ghislain spoke decisively. "That’s why we’re robbing them. I’m not a fan of starving while training. That’s only for emergencies. So, how have you been funding your journey so far?" Julien scratched his head. "We’ve been doing odd jobs—helping out with village requests, manual labor, or joining monster hunts when we could." "Have you taken down bandits before? Did you take their money?" "We’ve dealt with bandits a few times, but we only kept a little for ourselves and gave the rest to the local villages." Ghislain’s eyes widened in disbelief. "What? You gave it all away?" "Yeah, because of those bandits, so many people suffered. That’s why we gave it all away to those in need," Julien said with an expression that made it clear he found this the most natural thing to do. Beside him, Deneb nodded in agreement. Only Kyle looked slightly dissatisfied, pouting his lips. Ghislain let out a low whistle of admiration as he looked at Julien and Deneb. "Wow…" Though he himself had helped a great number of people, he had never done so to this extent. They were still so young, yet their fundamental values were completely different. No wonder they were destined to become the Hero and the Saintess who saved the world. That said, their methods left room for debate regarding their efficiency. "That approach can only go so far." Had Ghislain given away every bit of money he earned, he would have been left with nothing. Instead, he had used his initial earnings to build businesses and significantly expand his wealth. His belief had always been that one needed strength and resources to help others effectively. As a result, he had been able to help many more people. Their intentions weren’t wrong. Even at their young age, they were doing their best to make a difference. Frankly, the fact that they were out there helping people at all at this age was remarkable. In his own previous life, Ghislain had been too preoccupied with survival to even consider helping others at that age. Placing a hand on Julien’s shoulder, Ghislain spoke. "From now on, you don’t need to do that. Just follow my lead. What’s most important is that you all grow stronger." "Is... that so?" "Yes. First, we’ll raid every bandit hideout nearby and secure some money. You need proper food and rest to train well. Got it?" "But… that’s not our money." "It’s fine. The people of this world owe you a massive debt. Actually, they’re going to owe you even more." The three companions looked at him with furrowed brows, clearly not understanding. Kyle, rubbing his swollen cheek, asked, "Why does the world owe us anything? We’re the ones who are in debt." Ghislain’s eyes widened in surprise. "What? You’re in debt?" Kyle pointed at Deneb. "Deneb’s parents sold her to the temple when she was a kid. The money the temple gave is considered her debt." Turning to Deneb, Ghislain saw her nod with a somber expression. Her story was truly a mess. Apparently, Deneb had accidentally exhibited divine powers as a child, which led a nearby temple to pay a hefty sum to take her in. In this era, it wasn’t uncommon for children with latent divine powers to be taken by temples in this manner. The problem was that Deneb’s divine powers never truly developed. Despite years of training, her abilities remained at the same level they had been when she was a child. Eventually, the temple had given up on her, providing her with minimal combat training before sending her out into the world—alone, as no one wanted to accompany her. "They call it a ‘missionary journey,’ but it’s just an excuse to make her fend for herself while earning money. Helping people along the way is just a bonus to bolster the temple’s reputation," Kyle grumbled. Deneb smiled faintly. "It’s okay. This trial must be part of the goddess’s plan. It’s my fault for being inadequate." Ghislain was momentarily speechless. Inadequate? Who? She simply hadn’t awakened yet. Deneb would go on to become the first Saintess capable of wielding the powers of all four goddesses. She was bound to awaken during this journey. Of course, only Ghislain knew this outcome, so the frustration was his alone to bear. Kyle, still grumbling, continued. "Anyway, when Deneb told us she was leaving on her journey, we decided to join her. We wanted to go on an adventure, too." "Do you have debt as well?" "Yeah, my father’s gambling debt got passed down to me. I promised to pay it off, so I left home to earn money. The lender agreed because they didn’t have any better options." "What about Julien?" "Julien’s an orphan," Kyle said. "But the villagers co-signed for a loan to help him, and when they couldn’t pay it back, they ran off. So now Julien owes a lot to a merchant guild." "And the guild just let him go?" Kyle shook his head. "Those money-grubbing devils? Not a chance. Astion co-signed for him, promising to pay it off." "Astion did?" "Yeah. The guild trusts him because he’s a wizard." Ghislain blinked in disbelief. All three of them, still so young, were saddled with debt. It was a total disaster. Astion, it seemed, was the only one among them who didn’t owe anyone money. Being the most capable and intelligent of the group, he had become their de facto leader, and everyone relied on his guidance. Under Astion’s direction, they had grown stronger at an incredible pace. Even with their debts, Julien and Deneb insisted on helping those in need, despite Astion’s objections. No matter what he said, they wouldn’t stop. "Good grief… debtors giving everything away…" Ghislain couldn’t decide whether to admire or pity them. It was both noble and frustrating to watch them sacrifice themselves for others. A sudden thought crossed his mind. "Is there a way to seal the Demonic Realm while saving them as well?" Though these events had already occurred, perhaps his presence here could change things. What would happen to reality if he succeeded? The task would be monumentally difficult, but the possibility intrigued him. "There must be a reason I was brought here. This can’t just be a coincidence." For now, he didn’t have the answers. He would need to stay in this era longer to find out. Shaking off his musings, Ghislain spoke brightly. "Alright, I understand your circumstances now. But from this point on, stop doing things that way. From now on, you follow my lead. Got it? Now let’s go earn some—" "Who are you?! What did you do to my body?!" Ghislain froze mid-sentence as a loud voice erupted in his mind. Startled, he focused on the voice inside his consciousness. "Oh, is this the owner of the body?" "Who the hell are you?! How did you take over my body?!" Astion’s panicked shout was quickly drowned out by another voice. "You! Become my subordinate!" "Argh! Who the hell is this black thing now?!" "Ugh, why is it so cramped in here? Where did you come from?!" "I should be asking that! Why are there two of you inside my body?!" As Astion erupted in frustration, Dark replied with a smug tone. "Why do you think this is your body?" "What?!" "Once we’ve taken it over, it’s ours now." Dark’s shameless response made Ghislain involuntarily nod in agreement. Astion, the rightful owner of the body, was left utterly dumbfounded.
