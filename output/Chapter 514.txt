Ghislain had refrained from moving directly to the fourth stage of his core cultivation due to the importance of stability and balance. In the third stage, cores were positioned in his chest and below his navel. The next set of cores would be located in his thighs. To maintain equilibrium, he had to create them simultaneously in both thighs. "Hah..." A crimson breath escaped Ghislain’s lips. Five cores now rotated in unison, drawing mana and circulating it throughout his body. "I’ll have to distribute this carefully." With Dark’s power fully exhausted, Ghislain could no longer amplify his mana through external means. The newly generated cores were replenishing the rest of his system, but they remained fragile, holding less than half the capacity of his original cores. "Still, it’s enough." The core cultivation method was designed for bursts of explosive power. Proper distribution would allow him to exceed his usual limits, even if briefly. Ghislain smirked, his voice light despite his exhaustion. "Don’t you think we’ve dragged this out too long? At this rate, the sun will rise before we finish." The battle had stretched on for hours. Ghislain had carefully managed his strength, turning it into a prolonged war of attrition. At his words, Kaien glanced at the sky, realizing for the first time how much time had passed. The stars above had long replaced the sun. "When did it get so late?" They had arrived in the afternoon. After what felt like an eternity of clashing steel, half a day had slipped by without either gaining the upper hand. The intense focus on their duel had placed them in an entirely different dimension of time, leaving them oblivious to the world around them. Kaien tightened his grip on his sword, staring at Ghislain. "You regained your strength somehow. I was sure your mana was completely depleted." Ghislain shrugged. His recovery defied not only Kaien’s expectations but the laws of nature itself. "Let’s just say it’s a skill honed through dancing on the edge of life and death." Kaien’s eyes narrowed. "Remarkable. But why didn’t you use this power from the start?" Had Ghislain unleashed his full strength earlier, the battle would have concluded much faster—regardless of the victor. Ghislain chuckled, shaking his head slightly. "It’s not as simple as that. You’re stronger than I expected, and this isn’t a power I can summon at will." Creating new cores was not a decision he made lightly. The process required him to drain his life force completely, making it a last resort. Moreover, his body had only recently become capable of housing a fifth core, thanks to training with Dark’s amplification. Even now, the strain was immense, and his body remained unstable. Rumble. Ghislain clenched his jaw as he felt the burden of his new cores. His bones and muscles began to strain under the pressure, their structure warping from the overwhelming energy coursing through them. The newly formed cores were not yet fully integrated. Wild mana threatened to spill out with every movement, forcing him to suppress it manually. He would need days of rest after this battle to stabilize his condition. Kaien noticed the thin trail of blood at the corner of Ghislain’s lips and nodded grimly. "This isn’t a normal method, is it?" Kaien knew there had to be a price for such power. No warrior held back unless there was a risk of losing control. "A little extra mana won’t change the outcome." Boom! Kaien unleashed another ferocious strike, swinging his sword with relentless precision. Ghislain met him head-on, parrying the blow with his own blade. Thud! The clash left cracks in the ground beneath them, but Kaien still held the advantage. His overwhelming strength forced Ghislain to stay on the defensive. Kaien maintained his calm, his strikes calculated and deliberate. "No mistakes. His swordsmanship remains dangerous." The slightest slip would leave him vulnerable to Ghislain’s unpredictable attacks. Kaien absorbed minor wounds without flinching, retaliating with crushing counterblows. Ghislain gritted his teeth, his body trembling under the assault. "He’s extraordinary." Even while holding the upper hand, Kaien showed no arrogance or carelessness. Such discipline in the heat of battle was rare, even among the strongest warriors. To overcome such an opponent, there was only one option. More power. Ghislain’s eyes burned crimson, his five cores spinning faster as they drew in and condensed mana. Boom! His next strike forced Kaien to take a step back. "Just a little more." Ghislain’s teeth clenched as he swung again. Crash! "More!" Kaien was driven further back, his defense wavering under the escalating pressure. "What in the..." For the first time, Kaien felt overwhelmed. Ghislain was growing stronger with each passing second—a phenomenon Kaien couldn’t comprehend. Forced to abandon his cautious strategy, Kaien poured every ounce of his remaining mana into his attacks. Boom! Boom! Boom! Despite his growing strength, Ghislain knew he was nearing his limit. "This is it for now." He couldn’t push his body any further without risking complete collapse. Holding his current state was all he could manage. Kaien, too, recognized the stalemate. Neither could overpower the other outright. Victory would go to whoever held out longer—or whoever made the first mistake. Their blades clashed violently, sending shockwaves across the battlefield. Both warriors bled from countless wounds, their bodies battered and broken. Every strike became a desperate gamble, each seeking to deliver a decisive blow. The soldiers on both sides could only watch, their weapons clenched in trembling hands. As dawn broke over the horizon, both fighters collapsed simultaneously. They lay in the dirt, gasping for breath, blood pooling around them. Kaien struggled to rise, his body trembling with exertion. "You... bastard..." Ghislain grinned through bloodied teeth. "What’s wrong? Already tired? I still feel great." Kaien sneered. "Don’t bluff." Both men were at their limits, yet neither would admit defeat. Kaien gripped his sword tightly, forcing himself forward. "Let’s finish this." Ghislain steadied himself, his blade raised once more. Boom! Their final clash loomed as their armies stood silent, awestruck by the sight of two legends fighting to the bitter end. Even as their movements slowed, the power and resolve behind their strikes remained undeniable. Blood spilled with every swing, both warriors struggling to remain on their feet. Finally, they fell again, too exhausted to continue. Kaien coughed up blood, his voice hoarse as he glared at Ghislain. "It’s a shame..." Ghislain gripped the hilt of his sword, planted firmly in the ground, and asked calmly: "What do you mean?" Kaien, still breathing heavily, responded: "That I can’t settle this fight any further." Ghislain chuckled bitterly. "Says who?" Kaien’s voice steadied as he delivered his next words: "As the Kingdom’s strongest swordsman, my part in this ends here." Ghislain’s expression shifted. "Is that so?" Kaien exhaled deeply. As much as he wanted this duel to remain a contest of skill, he wasn’t just a swordsman. He was the commander of the southern forces and a loyal servant of the Ducal House of Delphine. Personal pride wasn’t what mattered here. Kaien chuckled self-deprecatingly. "I will set aside the name and pride of the Kingdom’s strongest swordsman for now." Victory in this war was paramount. If he rallied his troops, they could certainly kill Ghislain. And if Ghislain fell, the war would be as good as won. His forces, though exhausted, outnumbered the Fenris mercenaries two to one. While Kaien fought, his soldiers had rested, if only briefly. "I’m sorry to tarnish this duel. I’ll carry that shame to my grave." Kaien forced himself upright. His legs trembled under his weight, but he managed to stand. Ghislain, however, remained on the ground, struggling to rise. Kaien steadied his sword and pointed it forward. "And you... I’ll remember you. You were truly formidable." The atmosphere turned heavy as both armies readied their weapons. The Fenris mercenaries gripped their spears, while the Delphine cavalry prepared their swords. At Kaien’s command, a charge would commence. Kaien ignored the tension and spoke with a grim resolve. "All forces, prepare to—" Before he could finish, Ghislain interrupted: "You’ll finish this fight with me. Your army won’t move." Kaien’s eyes narrowed. "What are you talking about?" Ghislain smirked. "Look to your side." Kaien turned his head slowly, his gaze falling on a nearby hill. Standing there was a man dressed as a noble, flanked by several knights. Kaien recognized him instantly. "Count Mowbray?" A cold chill ran down Kaien’s spine. How long had they been there? How had he not noticed them? Consumed by the intensity of his duel with Ghislain, Kaien had failed to sense their arrival. The rest of the soldiers had seen the newcomers but hadn’t dared move. The ferocity of Ghislain and Kaien’s battle had commanded their full attention. Count Mowbray raised his hand, signaling a knight beside him. The knight blew a horn, its deep sound reverberating through the air. Buuuuuuuuu! From behind the hill, a column of dust rose as a thousand cavalry soldiers rode into view—Count Mowbray’s personal forces. Kaien’s brow furrowed as he muttered: "Damn it..." While his forces still held the numerical advantage, the arrival of reinforcements meant increased casualties, a risk he could ill afford. Kaien growled, turning his gaze back to Ghislain. "So you delayed this fight to buy time? You had no intention of settling this duel fairly." Ghislain’s grin widened. "No, they’ve been here for quite a while." Count Mowbray’s forces had arrived before dawn. Ghislain had deliberately sent Dark to keep them at bay, ensuring they wouldn’t interfere with his duel. Kaien clenched his jaw. "Even so, this changes nothing. Even with their reinforcements, you’ll die in the chaos." Ghislain chuckled darkly. "You think that’s all? Look again." Kaien turned back toward the hill, just as another massive dust cloud appeared behind Count Mowbray’s forces. Emerging from the haze was an army of mounted soldiers, five times the size of Mowbray’s. "Waaaaaaaah!" The thunderous cheers of the advancing cavalry shook the air. Kaien’s face turned pale as he took in the sight. There were tens of thousands of them, their sheer numbers dwarfing both armies already present. Kaien’s voice trembled. "This... What in the world..." The newly arrived soldiers were not regular troops. Their formations were disorganized, their weapons and armor mismatched. They looked more like bandits than a disciplined army. But one thing unified them: the banners they carried, emblazoned with the emblem of the Fenris Mercenary Corps. Kaien’s voice wavered as he muttered: "The Fenris Mercenaries?" He stared at the flags in disbelief. The mercenaries had been rapidly expanding their influence across the continent. Kaien had assumed their forces were spread thin, with most units deployed to other kingdoms. "How... How could they be here?" Kaien knew of the Fenris Mercenaries’ operations. Only a fraction of their forces had been left for regional stabilization, with the bulk sent abroad to fulfill contracts. He had dismissed them as a non-threat. But now, tens of thousands had arrived unexpectedly. Kaien turned back to Ghislain, his voice tinged with desperation. "You... Did you plan this from the beginning?" Ghislain nodded, his grin never faltering. "Of course. My father and I began gathering them long before we marched on the capital. They’ve simply followed me here." Kaien’s expression turned hollow. Their position was hopeless. The combined enemy forces now doubled his own, and his soldiers were starving and exhausted. Any attempt to fight would end in slaughter. Kaien’s shoulders sagged as he repeated numbly: "How... How could this happen..." The realization hit him like a hammer. From the very beginning, they had been playing into Ghislain’s hands. Every step of the way, he had manipulated them. Kaien staggered, his vision spinning. "It’s over." If he had been in peak condition, perhaps he could have held his ground. At the very least, he might have escaped. But now, both he and his 40,000 cavalry were doomed. Kaien turned to Ghislain, his eyes filled with resignation and a trace of admiration. "Who are you? How can someone like you exist? How do you know so much, plan so far ahead?" Ghislain chuckled, his voice steady despite his battered body. "Me? There are many names people call me by." The Fool of the North, the Heir of Ferdium, the Lord of Fenris, the Saint of the Capital, the Commander of the Northern Army... But none of those titles were what he wanted to say now. Ghislain slowly pushed himself to his feet. His body screamed in pain, but he straightened his back nonetheless. In his past life, he hadn’t had the chance to say it. He had failed to meet Kaien or the Duke of Delphine, losing the war before he could declare who he truly was. But now, standing victorious on this battlefield, he could finally say it. Ghislain took a deep breath, staring Kaien down with unwavering eyes. "I am..." He exhaled slowly, his voice rising with unwavering confidence: "Ghislain Ferdium, the King of Mercenaries."
