When Ghislain arrived in the capital, word of his presence quickly spread, drawing crowds eager to catch a glimpse of him. “It’s the Commander of the Northern Army!” “They say he’s single-handedly eliminating the Rifts!” “He’s the kingdom’s last hope!” By now, Ghislain’s name was known to everyone in the Kingdom of Rutania. Since the outbreak of the Rifts and the ensuing plagues, the kingdom’s economy had suffered worse than during any drought. Without Ghislain and his northern army, recovery would not have come as swiftly as it had. On top of that, his actions—disciplining selfish lords and distributing medicine to the people—made him a celebrated hero among the common folk. At some point, Ghislain had become the symbol of hope, the hero destined to end this era of chaos. As Ghislain entered the capital to resounding cheers, Maurice McQuarry, the kingdom’s Commander-in-Chief, greeted him warmly. It was rare for someone of Maurice’s rank to personally welcome anyone. “There’s my nephew!” “….” “Oh, come now, my hardworking nephew!” Maurice laughed heartily and clapped Ghislain on the shoulder. To Maurice, Ghislain was a godsend, taking on the brunt of the kingdom’s problems with his northern army. Thanks to him, Maurice had been able to concentrate the royal army on guarding the southern borders and containing the ducal faction. Ghislain, however, was quietly wondering when exactly he had become Marquis McQuarry’s “nephew.” “Come, let’s head inside. Everyone’s waiting.” Welcomed by the royalist nobles, Ghislain entered the royal palace, where he was promptly ushered into a grand hall. There, he met a gathering of ornately dressed delegates from various kingdoms, alongside Marquis Branford and key figures from the royal faction. “Ah, you’ve arrived,” said Marquis Branford, his sharp tone cutting through the formalities. Ghislain offered a polite nod but couldn’t help noticing the toll recent events had taken on Branford. The once razor-sharp marquis now carried an air of exhaustion. _"He’s not what he used to be,"_ Ghislain thought. It was no wonder. The kingdom had faced one crisis after another, and even the royal faction had struggled to maintain control. In the end, it was the northern army that had stepped in, resolving problems through sheer might. _"That’s probably why they’ve handed me so much authority, using me as their sword."_ The representatives introduced themselves, starting with delegates from the neighboring Kingdom of Sairon, all the way to the distant Lombars Kingdom. One envoy from the Kingdom of Grimwell, a powerful nation comparable to Rutania, cleared his throat and spoke up. “Not every kingdom has arrived yet, but we cannot wait forever. We should begin discussions now. Those who join later can be integrated into the coalition as we proceed. Most of the major kingdoms are represented here, after all.” Grimwell had historically been the first to propose a united front against the Rifts in Ghislain’s previous life. However, this time, circumstances were different. Their involvement was only due to Rutania’s overwhelming support. While they outwardly claimed they were answering Rutania’s call, it was clear Grimwell was here out of necessity. Marquis Branford nodded in agreement. “No one here would have come without reason. Though Rutania proposed this initiative, all of you are here because you agree on its necessity, correct?” “Indeed,” the Grimwell envoy replied. “This is a calamity that threatens all humanity. To face the Salvation Order and the Rifts, closer cooperation is essential. I believe we’re all in agreement on that. In fact, we’ve prepared a draft proposal for the coalition.” The envoy handed out documents to everyone in the room, clearly attempting to seize the initiative. The proposal outlined steps such as opening borders, resource sharing, troop deployments, the creation of a unified command structure, and the establishment of a coalition assembly with an elected chairperson. While the contents were extensive, they weren’t particularly groundbreaking. Essentially, it called for relaxing restrictions between kingdoms to foster greater collaboration. The only contentious point was that Grimwell seemed to position itself to lead the coalition effort. Grimwell’s envoy smiled brightly as he continued, “We are deeply grateful for Rutania’s humanitarian aid. This crisis cannot be solved by any one kingdom. It’s a shared responsibility, and together, we can overcome it.” “An admirable sentiment,” Branford remarked. “Judging from the draft, it seems you propose Grimwell’s chancellor as the chair of the coalition assembly?” “If entrusted with this responsibility, Grimwell will lead the coalition effectively,” the envoy replied confidently. Branford seemed satisfied with the suggestion. Grimwell’s chancellor was a well-known and capable figure. Entrusting him with the role of chairperson wasn’t unreasonable. But when Branford turned to Ghislain for his opinion, Ghislain’s response was swift and curt. “I don’t like it.” Branford raised an eyebrow, surprised. Ghislain had been the one advocating for greater support to other kingdoms. He had even been the driving force behind assembling the delegates. Now, to hear him object was unexpected. _"Could it be… Is this about the chairmanship?"_ Branford wondered. Ghislain had never shown much interest in power or titles before, so the sudden shift puzzled him. The other delegates were equally taken aback. Rutania had extended a lifeline to many of their kingdoms, so this sudden resistance seemed inexplicable. Ghislain leaned back in his chair, speaking with a casual tone. “Actually, I called this meeting for another reason—to settle accounts.” “Accounts…?” “Yes. We’ve been providing food and medicine to your kingdoms, but this can’t go on forever. Resources aren’t infinite.” The room fell silent. Most of the kingdoms represented here were on the verge of collapse, overrun by the Salvation Order and Riftspawn. Without Rutania’s aid, they would have been unable to sustain even a basic defense. Grimwell’s envoy cleared his throat awkwardly. “We are, of course, immensely grateful for Rutania’s generosity. But smaller kingdoms are in dire straits. Without your continued support, they may fall entirely. Surely you understand the implications?” Ghislain smirked. “Who doesn’t?” “Then what do you propose?” “That you pay your dues.” Branford watched Ghislain with intrigue. It was a stark shift from his earlier stance, when he had urged unconditional support. Clearly, Ghislain had a larger strategy in mind. Grimwell’s envoy pressed on. “Few kingdoms can match Rutania’s resources. Many are barely breathing. What are you asking for?” “Jewels, artworks, precious metals—whatever you can spare. Surely that’s not too much to ask?” The delegates exchanged uneasy glances. Luxury items held little value in times of war, but their worth would skyrocket once peace returned. Surrendering them now was a bitter pill to swallow. Still, they had no choice. Without Rutania’s aid, survival was impossible. “Very well,” the Grimwell envoy conceded. “At current market rates?” “Of course.” Having secured agreement, the Grimwell envoy hastily tried to shift the discussion back to the coalition structure. “Now, about the coalition’s operational framework. We need to establish protocols for troop deployment and governance—” Ghislain cut him off. “Troops.” “Excuse me?” “The first thing I need is for your kingdoms to send reinforcements to us.” The delegates looked at him in confusion. They were all locked in desperate battles against the Rifts in their own territories. How could they possibly spare soldiers? The delegates were dumbfounded. Sending reinforcements, particularly to the most stable kingdom, Rutania, seemed absurd. Seeing their confusion, Ghislain elaborated. “Why not? Isn’t the whole point of forming a coalition to fight together? Troop deployments were even included in the draft proposal you just presented.” “Well, yes, but… asking us to reinforce Rutania first? Your kingdom is handling things better than anyone else right now. Other kingdoms are struggling far more,” one envoy protested. “And yet, the Kingdom of Grimwell seems to be holding up just fine, doesn’t it?” The Grimwell envoy fell silent. It was true; Grimwell was in better shape than most other nations. While their initial response had been slow, their military strength and the royal family’s dominance over rebellious nobles had kept the situation manageable. Still, they balked at the idea of sending troops elsewhere. Grimwell’s own Rift problems were far from resolved. Ghislain’s sharp gaze swept over the room. “We’ll likely be the first on this continent to halt the expansion of the Rifts.” “Well… yes, that much is well known,” a delegate stammered. “If our forces were to assist your kingdoms, it would undoubtedly make a significant impact.” At this, some envoys smiled faintly. In truth, the primary reason for forming the coalition was precisely this: to secure the support of Rutania’s northern army, whose efficiency in dealing with the Rifts was unmatched. Ghislain’s tone hardened as he continued. “But Rutania has the Delphine ducal faction, which is allied with the Salvation Order.” At the mention of the Delphine faction, the delegates’ faces darkened. The power of the Delphine ducal house was well-known across Rutania and its neighboring kingdoms. Even nations further afield had a sense of the faction’s influence. Ghislain’s piercing gaze bore into the delegates as he pressed the point. “The Delphine faction is formidable. And since their aim is to seize control of Rutania, it’s likely that more priests from the Salvation Order have been dispatched here than anywhere else. Let me ask you this: if we fall, will that be good news for your kingdoms?” The room fell into an uneasy silence. Thanks to Rutania, the other kingdoms had been able to maintain some semblance of order, securing enough resources to field armies and distribute medicine. Rutania’s efforts had given humanity its only glimmer of hope in this dark time. If the Delphine faction were to win their civil war, that hope would vanish. The morale of the other kingdoms would crumble, and humanity might spiral into collective despair. Ghislain drove the point home. “Unless the Delphine faction is dealt with first, Rutania’s forces won’t be able to assist your kingdoms. Those with the means must send reinforcements immediately. Understood?” The envoys exchanged uneasy glances. This wasn’t what they had expected. Their goal had been to establish a coalition, gradually negotiating terms and extracting mutual benefits for their kingdoms. They had been prepared for a protracted and intricate process—diplomacy at its slowest and most methodical. But Ghislain wasn’t interested in such drawn-out games. He intended to move swiftly and efficiently, cutting through the bureaucracy. _"In my previous life, we delayed too much, and the damage only grew."_ Ghislain had experienced this firsthand in his past life. Each kingdom had prioritized its own interests, and the negotiations dragged on. By the time any meaningful agreement was reached, humanity had already lost significant ground. To avoid repeating that disaster, Ghislain had used Marquis Branford to expedite the process, gathering the envoys with unprecedented speed. _"The Salvation Order’s priests have now fully entered the fray. This is not the same scenario as before."_ In his previous life, the Salvation Order had hidden in the shadows, prolonging their deception. Now, they were openly participating in the war. The early stages of a conflict were critical. When the balance of power was still even, it was essential to seize the initiative and establish dominance. _"No matter what, the Delphine faction and the Salvation Order must be eradicated first."_ Ghislain was unwavering on this point. If the other kingdoms wanted to join the coalition, their first contribution would have to be reinforcements for Rutania.
