Lowell frantically shook his head and asked again, incredulous. “You’re just going to keep printing money?” “Exactly! We’ll keep releasing it and adjust the flow as needed. That way, it’ll last forever! Besides, the current amount of currency can’t keep up with our ever-growing production. We need something to replace gold coins eventually!” “You’re seriously spouting this madness just to cover your own debt…” Lowell started to retort angrily but stopped mid-sentence. What if this insane plan actually worked? ‘We could seize control of the continent’s economy!’ Given the current circumstances, there was a good chance that Ruthania’s currency would become the standard across the continent. Initially, the kingdom would back its value, and its convenience would draw widespread adoption. Despite the dubious origins of this plan—rooted in debt—it was terrifyingly revolutionary. If the kingdom kept printing money, its debt would continuously grow, turning into an unstoppable machine once it got rolling. ‘Could this really work? It’s so reckless, but… it might?’ If successful, the economic shift from tangible assets to credit could change everything. And that credit would be guaranteed by Ruthania’s military and production power. But how would this new system be established? Would people accept mere paper as money? As Lowell lost himself in thought, Claude grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him. “I’ve thought it through—it’s possible! We just need to get started! So either help me get the money, or get out of my way!” “Do you seriously think this will work?” “It will if people believe it will! Money is all about trust!” “You… absolute lunatic…” As the two bickered, a soldier burst in, shouting urgently: “Duke Ghislain has arrived!” “W-what?” Claude spun around, his disheveled appearance a testament to his desperation. The last person he wanted to see at this moment had arrived. Sure enough, Ghislain approached with his knights in tow. Seeing Claude clutching Lowell by the collar, Ghislain clicked his tongue. “What’s this? Weren’t you supposed to be out hunting bandits?” “Well… you see… uh…” Caught red-handed, Claude stammered, trying to explain himself. But his silver tongue soon took over. “The newly integrated territories have suffered severe plundering, leaving the people unable to rebuild their lives. So, I came here to secure funds from Rimhal to support them…” Claude’s words flowed as smoothly as a seasoned orator’s. Lowell stared at him in disbelief, utterly dumbfounded. Ghislain chuckled, clearly seeing through the excuse but choosing not to confront him. Turning to Lowell, Ghislain asked, “Out on an inspection?” “Yes, that’s correct. But Steward Claude here was just…” Lowell decided to report Claude’s intentions, but Ghislain interrupted, cutting straight to the point. “There’s plenty of money here, right?” “Uh, yes. This city probably has the most liquid assets in the kingdom.” “Good. Leave the minimum operating funds and prepare to transfer the rest. I’ll need all of it.” “All of it?” “Yes, every bit. I’ve got a lot to spend it on.” Both Lowell and Claude gawked at him. While they always struggled with shortages, Ghislain seemed intent on spending money as freely as possible. Feeling slighted, Claude snapped, “Why are you always so eager to blow through money? There are so many expenses these days! Have you never heard of saving?” Lowell’s jaw dropped. Of all people, Claude was the last person who should be making this argument. Ghislain, unbothered, replied confidently, “I’ve never saved a single coin in my life.” Beside him, Belinda nodded solemnly, recalling how even as a child, Ghislain would immediately spend any allowance he received. “…” Claude and Lowell fell silent. Faced with such blatant honesty, there was little they could say. “What’s the problem?” Ghislain continued. “If we run out of money, we’ll just find more. When you spend, you should spend big.” Claude hesitated before asking, “And where will you find it?” “Anywhere. Someone always has money, or there’s something out there worth turning into money.” Lowell glanced between Ghislain and Claude. One was proposing to print endless money, while the other treated wealth as if it fell from the sky. Their logic was incomprehensible to him. Ghislain, however, was entirely serious. In his past life, he’d survived as a mercenary without a single coin to his name. Money or no money, he always found a way to live. “Without money, you can still be happy. With money, you can be even happier. That’s the kind of man I am.” “…” Of course, it wasn’t as if Ghislain handled finances himself. People like Claude, Lowell, and Rosalyn were always there to manage the details. With a nonchalant wave, Ghislain urged, “Hurry up and gather the funds. I need a lot of money right now.” “What for?” “I’m going to use it to develop the Beast Forest—hire workers, pay soldiers, buy materials… there’s a lot to do.” “You’re planning to spend that much all at once?” “To make real progress, you need to spend big,” Ghislain said with a grin. While others were busy with post-war recovery, Ghislain had spent his downtime training, honing the skills he’d learned in his dreams. He’d combined techniques from the heroic figures and villains he’d seen in his visions, pushing his abilities to new heights. “The dreams have been more frequent,” he mused. Visions of epic battles between heroes and apostles, clashes between champions and adversaries—each dream urged him to grow stronger. Although the Saintess hadn’t appeared again, the dreams were filled with scenes of combat, spurring him to keep training. Now, Ghislain’s improved skills left him itching for action. When power grows, the desire to test it inevitably follows. Turning to Claude, he asked, “Are you coming with us?” “No, I’ve got plenty of work to do—bandit hunts, and, uh, developing a new economic system.” “Interesting. Let me know when it’s ready. I’d like to hear about it.” “Yes, sir.” Lowell hesitated, debating whether to interject, but ultimately held his tongue. For now, it was enough that Claude wouldn’t be taking any money. As Ghislain issued notices and mobilized funds, workers from across the kingdom flocked to join his project. “Joining this is a no-brainer!” “If you work for the Duke, you’ll make a fortune!” “They say he spends like there’s no tomorrow. Doesn’t even believe in saving!” “Somehow, that suits him perfectly!” Word spread quickly, and soon the northern lords sighed in resignation. Among the nobles of Ruthania, especially the Count of Jimbar, whose lands bordered the Feridum Estate, a deep sigh seemed to be a constant companion. “Haah... Why does everything I try go wrong?” The Count had once joined the Northern Alliance and attacked Amelia from the rear. Most of his allies were killed, but he escaped and survived. However, his losses were substantial. The forces he painstakingly rebuilt after that defeat were eventually handed over to Ghislain through negotiations, persuasion, and clever diplomacy. Even the Northern Alliance, which he helped form, had been dissolved on the very day it was created—a humiliation that still stung. “Why won’t they return the troops...?” In the Northern territories, all but the bare minimum of forces needed for local security had been requisitioned by the Northern Army. The Northern Army, however, had yet to be disbanded. The war was over, and the Count had expected the forces to be returned. Yet, under the pretext of ensuring national stability, Ghislain continued to command them. Deprived of their usual power and influence, the Northern lords often gathered at the Jimbar Estate to console each other. Like the Count, they sighed heavily as they shared their woes. “The world is becoming more livable, and public sentiment has shifted entirely toward the Duke. Even the soldiers are satisfied. Asking for the troops back now would only make us look like ungrateful scoundrels.” “True. If not for him, we’d all be dead.” “Either Desmond would have killed us, or we’d have perished at the hands of the Delphine Duke.” “Maybe even Count Rayfold would have done us in.” In hindsight, being forced to relinquish their forces to Ghislain had been a blessing in disguise. They had avoided the civil war, survived the calamities of famine and plague, and even weathered the Rift crisis unscathed. They had done nothing, yet they reaped all the benefits. Moreover, the financial and food aid they received for estate management left them with little room to complain. Thus, they set their sights on a new strategy. “Let’s issue a public call for laborers on a large scale.” “We should send as many workers as we can from our estates.” “With the Northern territories closer to the Beast Forest, it’s easier for us to dispatch people for the development project.” Their hope was to collect additional taxes through these efforts. Fortunately, a massive number of people volunteered for the initiative. While the Northern lords were pleased with the turnout, they couldn’t help but feel bitter about Ghislain’s overwhelming popularity. Across the kingdom, a total of 10,000 laborers were recruited. So many children tried to join that they had to be sent back home, which caused further delays. These laborers quickly began expanding the base camp in the Beast Forest. With such a large workforce, ensuring proper supplies and logistics became critical. The elite Northern Army, 40,000 strong, was also dispatched for the development effort and began preparations to march. Thanks to the laborers' efforts, the base camp was rapidly completed. Soon, the Northern Army marched proudly into the forest, led by Ghislain. Surveying the troops, Ghislain smiled and spoke. “This time, I don’t have much to say. It won’t be too hard, but don’t get complacent.” “Waaaaaaah!” The soldiers roared with enthusiasm, their morale soaring to the heavens. Having triumphed over countless trials, the Northern Army no longer feared the Beast Forest. Skovan and Ricardo looked upon the magnificent display of military strength with sentimental expressions. “Wow. The first time we came here, we only had a few mercenaries with us.” “The second time was better—we had a decent number.” “But this... this is overwhelming.” Skovan glanced toward Elena, who sat proudly atop a massive warhorse, exuding an aura of confidence. Her oversized warhammer necessitated a special horse, one they had scoured the kingdom to find. “Our princess has changed a lot. She once aspired to be a graceful lady.” “Well, you can’t escape your bloodline.” “True… Let’s do our best to keep up.” With unwavering determination, the Northern Army pressed deeper into the forest. The path to where they had previously defeated Queen Grex was now clear, allowing for smooth progress. This time, their goal was to reach the forest’s core. Once they did, they planned to gradually work their way out, clearing and developing the forest from the inside. The plan also involved scorching the surrounding area to prevent monster resurgence. Laborers followed closely behind the soldiers, ready to begin the process of clearing and transforming the land. Boom! Boom! Thud! As the vast workforce set to work, towering trees fell rapidly, clearing the way. Monsters, sensing the intrusion, occasionally approached but were swiftly slaughtered before they could pose a threat. Reaching a new area, the Northern Army stumbled upon something extraordinary—a vast field of dark crimson crystals emitting an ominous energy. The soldiers murmured among themselves. “Are those gemstones?” “Can we mine them?” “They look... unsettling.” As they debated, the crystals began to stir. Crrrkkk… Crrrkkk… The crystals started rising, forming into towering humanoid shapes. Some even resembled lions. Grk… Grk… Grkrrkkk! Every movement produced a grating sound, as if something sharp were grinding against stone. The crystalline entities, numbering in the hundreds, began advancing toward the intruders. Thud! Thud! Thud! Even hundreds of such massive creatures might have been terrifying once. But with their current strength, the Northern Army felt no fear. The soldiers naturally shifted into battle formations, their movements precise and coordinated. Watching the scene unfold, Belinda remarked calmly, “Looks like monsters have shown up.” “You can’t call them monsters anymore,” Ghislain replied. “Then what are they?” Ghislain grinned. “They’re money.” As always, there was treasure hidden in every corner of the world—if you had the strength to seize it.
