‘This place...’ Ghislain looked around. It was the battlefield again. The location had changed, but the situation was the same as in his previous dream. “Waaaaaaah!” An army resembling the modern-day Human Alliance was fighting against the Rift creatures. ‘They truly fought endlessly in those days.’ He still couldn’t understand why no records of such a harrowing war had survived. If even a fraction of these events had been documented, humanity wouldn’t have suffered so greatly before his regression. Though he couldn’t fully trust the dream, Berhem’s words about the erasure of old records weighed on his mind. — _There’s nothing left. They said people of that time deliberately erased all the records._ Ghislain wasn’t sure if this dream was connected to those events, but one thing was certain: the founding history of Ruthania had been intentionally erased. Even the king didn’t know why the Shadow Order and the House of Delphine wielded such immense power. If this dream reflected reality, then it was likely that the records of this war had also been wiped out by those in power. As Ghislain scanned the battlefield, he noticed a familiar figure—the Saintess. Berhem’s words about her resurfaced in his mind. — _That necklace belonged to the “First Saintess,” a figure said to have monopolized the love of all goddesses._ ‘The First Saintess.’ The claim that she monopolized divine favor seemed plausible. After all, he had witnessed her miracles firsthand. — _The Founding King was said to be the Saintess’s servant._ ‘A servant.’ This meant that someone among those serving this Saintess could be the Founding King of Ruthania. That person must have received the Saintess’s necklace, which later became the royal family’s treasured heirloom. Shaking off his thoughts, Ghislain focused on the situation at hand. ‘I still have no idea what’s going on.’ All the information he had was fragmented. The connections were unclear, and he couldn’t even be certain if this dream was real. All he could do was follow the clues the dream revealed, step by step. “Waaaaaaah!” “Push them back!” “We can win this time as well!” Every time he observed this dream, Ghislain was struck by how overwhelmingly strong the humans were. They were utterly dominating the monsters. In his current era, the continent was thrown into chaos and division by the Salvation Order. But in this dream, humanity stood united, fighting as one against the monstrous creatures. _Kaaaaang!_ Even the mighty Equidema was overwhelmed by the united strength of humanity. Despite their massive numbers, the Rift creatures couldn’t break through the human forces. At the heart of this miraculous effort was the Saintess, standing in the middle of the battlefield. She was praying with her eyes closed. “...Hear the voice of your faithful servant. Protect and guide our warriors on this treacherous battlefield.” _Fwoooooosh!_ The heavens parted, and radiant light poured down. It scattered like a divine blessing, empowering the army of the Human Alliance. “Grant our blades the strength of your grace.” Light-infused auras began to emanate from the soldiers’ swords. “Reinforce our shields with your sacred light.” Their shields were enveloped in a protective divine glow. “Make our steps lighter so we may evade the attacks of our enemies.” A soft, luminous glow surrounded the soldiers' bodies, making their movements swifter and more agile. Even witnessing it a second time, it was a miracle that defied belief. The Saintess alone had bestowed blessings on an army numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Ghislain chuckled to himself. What others considered a divine miracle, this Saintess performed with ease. “Waaaaaaah!” The soldiers' morale soared to unimaginable heights, all thanks to the Saintess’s power. At this rate, the monsters would once again be driven back and annihilated. Even Ghislain, a master strategist, could tell at a glance. _Kaaaargh!_ Despite their overwhelming numbers, the Rift creatures were being pushed back. Across the battlefield, the Human Alliance’s superhumans were slaying Equidemas one by one. But war is hell, and unforeseen variables can arise at any moment. _Boom!_ Suddenly, a surge of black energy consumed the earth, spreading rapidly. Dark clouds billowed violently, resembling an oncoming horde of demons. The radiant light cast by the Saintess was smothered as the black energy engulfed the battlefield. _Fwoosh!_ Light clashed against darkness, neither side yielding an inch. As darkness claimed half the sky, the monsters rallied once more. Infused with the black energy, they grew even more ferocious and powerful. Despite this, humanity maintained its advantage, continuing to drive the monsters back. Then, it happened. _Fwoosh!_ Out of the darkness, hundreds of figures in black robes emerged. Ghislain’s gaze sharpened as he recognized them. ‘The Salvation Order.’ The black robes, the dark energy, and the unmistakable tattoos of a black sun on their hands and necks—there was no mistaking their identity. The Salvation Order had been active even in this distant past. ‘They’re no mere cult.’ It made sense why Ereneth despised the Salvation Order so much. Now, Ghislain’s curiosity deepened. How far back did these events stretch? There were rumors that Ereneth, the High Chief of the Elves, had lived for over a thousand years. Could this really be something from a millennium ago? ‘That can’t be.’ Even with their long lifespans, elves rarely lived beyond a millennium. Those who reached half that age were considered ancient. Ghislain’s musings were cut short. _Boom!_ The Salvation Order’s priests entered the fray, and humanity’s united forces began to falter. The priests were immensely powerful, but one among them stood out above the rest. From the center of the Salvation Order’s ranks emerged a priest. “All adjudicators, show no mercy! Crush the enemy! I will handle the Saintess myself.” Shrouded in black energy, his crimson eyes glowed ominously. _Boom!_ He became a streak of dark light, cutting through the human formation with ease. None could stop him. Seeing this, the soldiers of the Human Alliance roared with determination. “The Adversary has come!” “Stop him!” “Protect the Saintess!” Despite the Adversary’s overwhelming strength, the soldiers showed no fear, charging at him with eyes blazing with resolve. “Kill him!” “We must hold the line!” “Waaaaaaah!” But the Adversary was too powerful. “Insects.” _Boom!_ A black storm erupted from him, sweeping away everyone in its path. Ghislain narrowed his eyes as he observed the Adversary. ‘That bastard...’ He felt an intense sense of unease. To an outsider, it might seem as if this priest were Ghislain himself. The way the priest wielded his power was strikingly similar to Ghislain’s amplified state. _Boom! Boom! Boom!_ The Human Alliance fell like leaves before a storm, their formation riddled with gaping holes. The black storm surged forward, paying no heed to anything else. Its sole target seemed to be the Saintess radiating light in the rear. A terrifying display of power. Even the knights, armed with divine blessings, fell helplessly before the storm. Yet humanity was not so easily broken. They reformed their lines, using the sacrifices of their fallen comrades to block the Adversary’s path to the Saintess. “Protect the Saintess!” _Boom!_ Despite their determination, the formation collapsed under the relentless assault. None could withstand the black storm. At that moment, the Dwarf King, fighting on the right flank, slammed his halberd into the ground. _Rumble!_ A localized earthquake sent monsters and priests alike tumbling to the ground. The Dwarf King turned to face the black storm and roared with all his might. “―――!” Ghislain could barely make out what the Dwarf King was saying. From the left flank of the formation, Ereneth summoned massive high-ranking spirits. _Kwoooosh!_ The spirits stood firm, blocking the advancing monsters and priests. Seizing the opportunity, she pulled out her ultimate weapon, the **Elven Serenade** , and drew it. _Fwoooosh!_ A massive arrow radiating green light flew toward the black storm. Even the black storm, which had been advancing relentlessly, was forced to halt under its tremendous power. “Hmph!” The priest released a surge of dark energy, forming a massive shadowy barrier in front of him. _Boom!_ The arrow collided with the barrier and dissipated. While the barrier was destroyed, the priest remained unharmed. Other superhumans unleashed their magic and swung their swords at him, but he effortlessly blocked or dodged every attack. He didn’t seem interested in engaging anyone else. His objective was singular. _Kwoooosh!_ The black storm surged forward again, straight toward the Saintess. Nothing could stand in its way. Most of the forces standing between him and the Saintess had already been annihilated. It was an incredible display of power. Even Ghislain in his current state wouldn’t be capable of such a breakthrough. Even Julien, in his prime as the "Continent’s Greatest Swordsman," wouldn’t have been able to pull it off. The priest’s strength was truly beyond comprehension. Ereneth, seeing her attack fail, shouted something desperately. But once again, Ghislain couldn’t hear her words. Oddly, while other voices and sounds reached him, certain individuals’ words remained inaudible. The Saintess, who had been praying with her eyes closed, slowly opened them. The priest was now standing right in front of her. The troops around her didn’t dare approach. A Salvation Order priest stood before the Saintess, exuding an overwhelming aura. Glancing around briefly, the priest spoke. “It’s been a long time, Saintess.” “……” “I failed last time, but today, I will kill you.” The Saintess replied calmly. “It seems we meet again, adversary of the goddess, betrayer of humanity.” “I am but the first servant of the Church, a seeker of a new world, and the savior of the forsaken.” “But your soul will never be saved.” “I follow only the will of the god I believe in.” The priest raised his hand. If he brought it down, the Saintess would be torn apart. Yet the Saintess remained composed, her calm demeanor unshaken. What kind of indomitable will was hidden behind that ordinary exterior? The priest’s crimson eyes gleamed with irritation. “This is the end, Saintess. You will never reach the Holy Land.” With those words, he swung his hand. The knights nearby rushed to intercept him, but it was too late. _Boom!_ A massive burst of energy erupted, scattering light and darkness across the battlefield. The priest’s black, writhing hand was stopped mid-air by someone’s sword. The dark energy twisted violently, as if enraged. “You...” The man who had suddenly appeared to block the priest’s attack. His face looked as if it had been meticulously sculpted by a divine hand, perfectly flawless. His blue hair shimmered like the purest sky and the deepest ocean, embodying an overwhelming sense of passion. His eyes sparkled like a starry night sky, filled with the unyielding flames of courage. His confident smile radiated determination and hope, as if he were ready to save the world. If a legendary hero were to exist, this is what he would look like. As the mysterious man appeared, everyone on the battlefield erupted into cheers. “Waaaaaah!” The Dwarf King laughed heartily and slammed his halberd into the ground multiple times. Ereneth smiled brightly, overjoyed by his arrival. Even the other superhumans grinned, despite the dire situation. This reaction could only be seen from those who had absolute faith that this man’s presence would bring them victory. With his mere appearance, he filled everyone’s hearts with courage and hope, spreading an unshakable belief that no challenge was insurmountable. But Ghislain didn’t smile. Instead, he struggled to suppress his growing confusion. That man’s face was one he knew all too well. ‘What is this... Why is he here...?’ It was a face that shouldn’t exist in the past. No, it couldn’t be. He must be mistaken. It had to be someone who simply resembled him. Upon closer inspection, there were many differences. His hair wasn’t that vibrant, fiery blue. It was as dark as the night sky, like an unbroken veil of shadows. He wasn’t this expressive. His face had always been like a cold, emotionless marble statue. His eyes didn’t shine like stars. They harbored only a deep, unfathomable abyss. And yet... no matter how he looked at him, the resemblance was undeniable. Unconsciously, Ghislain muttered the name. “Julien.” _Flash!_ As soon as the name escaped his lips, Ghislain’s dream shattered.
