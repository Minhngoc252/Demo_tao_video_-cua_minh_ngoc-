The aura emanating from Ghislain had darkened, shifting from a deep crimson to an even denser shade of shadow. **"What kind of transcendent loses his sanity and forgets his own enlightenment? You're nothing but a farce."** This was where the Salvation Order had miscalculated. They believed that unleashing Melkir’s transcendent strength would make him unstoppable. But a transcendent isn’t defined merely by power. A true transcendent establishes their own mental domain—a world built on their will and enlightenment. Melkir, having lost his sanity and his domain, could no longer be called a transcendent. **"When you lose your techniques, enlightenment, and will, and wield nothing but bloated, chaotic mana, you’re weaker, not stronger."** For a normal knight, such brute power might have been an advantage, amplifying their physical capabilities several times over. But not for a transcendent. A transcendent is someone who controls time and space through their principles. Without that, they cannot stand against another transcendent. Melkir couldn’t even form an aura blade. The so-called "Holy Warrior" transformation of the Salvation Order merely granted brute strength, nothing more. **"Your experiments have failed. Not that you’d know, but they failed in my previous life too."** The Salvation Order’s experiments always ended in failure. Their subjects inevitably lost their sanity and died shortly after. Even in his past life, the Salvation Order hadn’t been able to refine their process to sustain a true transcendent. **"Raaaaargh!"** Melkir couldn’t understand Ghislain’s words. He simply let out a guttural roar, focused solely on destroying the target in front of him. Ghislain’s fist crashed into Melkir’s face again. _Boom!_ Melkir tried to resist, but Ghislain didn’t let up. His fists rained down mercilessly, striking Melkir’s face and body without pause. _Boom!_ _Crash!_ _Smash!_ The relentless assault caused Melkir’s face to cave in on one side. Even the black energy reinforcing his body couldn’t withstand the overwhelming force and began to dissipate. _Crash!_ _Smash!_ _Crack!_ Melkir’s arms fractured, and his legs bent in unnatural directions. He couldn’t even muster a counterattack. Ghislain didn’t allow him to fall. His fists hammered into Melkir with incredible speed, ensuring he stayed upright just long enough to absorb the punishment. _Boom!_ _Smash!_ _Boom!_ The black energy sustaining Melkir’s body unraveled and dissipated with each strike, unable to endure the sheer force of Ghislain’s blows. _Crunch._ Ghislain drew his fist back, a powerful aura gathering around it. In that brief moment, Melkir staggered, finally on the verge of collapse. But before he could hit the ground, Ghislain’s fist slammed into his face like a bolt of lightning. _Boom!_ Melkir’s head drove deep into the earth. **"Grrrkk…."** Melkir’s eyes briefly regained a flicker of lucidity. His facial structure was completely shattered, and his life was slipping away rapidly. Only the Salvation Order’s stubborn black energy clung to his fading vitality. For the first time in ages, Melkir’s voice managed to escape his broken mouth. **"W-wait…."** His shattered teeth made his words barely intelligible. He stared up at Ghislain with fearful eyes, the shadowy figure radiating a menacing crimson glow. ‘Why… why does he have the form of the Holy Warrior the Salvation Order desired…? Why am I regaining my sanity now? Wasn’t I supposed to lose all reason?’ His thoughts couldn’t continue. Ghislain raised his fist again, his voice calm yet charged with a sardonic edge. **"Funny how I’m avenging my mother by sheer accident. Not bad, actually. No, it’s a damn good situation. I’m killing two birds with one stone—a personal grudge and eliminating the Duke’s failed transcendent experiment."** Ghislain smirked, his crimson eyes glowing with an almost playful malice. He bore no personal hatred for Melkir, but knowing this man was the reason his mother’s life was cut short? That was enough for him. Still, he couldn’t ignore the irony. If not for Melkir’s actions, his mother would never have met his father, and Ghislain himself wouldn’t exist. A strange twist of fate, but not one he dwelled on. With that in mind, he decided not to drag things out further. **"This might sting a bit."** _Boom!_ Ghislain’s fist crashed into Melkir’s face once more. _Crack._ Melkir’s head shattered completely, burying deep into the ground. **"Huff…"** Ghislain stood tall, rolling his shoulders and letting his mana subside. It looked like an easy victory, but his body was aching all over. He’d burned through more than half of his mana reserves. The power of a "Holy Warrior," even one as incomplete as Melkir, wasn’t something to be taken lightly. **"He’d have given Tenant a good fight, though."** Ghislain chuckled to himself. Even without his enlightenment, Melkir had been formidable. Of course, a proper transcendent like Tenant would have emerged victorious in the end—after a hard-fought battle. **"Kong, come here."** The Black King, his steed, had wisely stayed far from the battlefield, chewing on grass nonchalantly as though none of this concerned him. He didn’t seem to think his master could lose. **"Let’s go."** Ghislain climbed onto the Black King’s back. Though he had sent Gillian ahead to secure the castle, he wanted to confirm everything with his own eyes. Kicking his steed into motion, Ghislain headed for the lord’s castle at full speed. *** The assassins who had broken through the perimeter stealthily infiltrated the lord’s castle, taking advantage of the shadows. Ordinary guards had no chance of stopping them. But the real challenge began after they entered the castle. With knights and soldiers stationed everywhere, the assassins were forced to remain hidden. _Rustle!_ Blending into their surroundings, they maneuvered carefully, utilizing the shadows of pillars, ceilings, and various objects to avoid detection. However, their movements weren’t flawless. Deviating from normal routes, they inadvertently triggered hidden magical alarms. _Bzzz!_ A wave of powerful mana rippled through the air as the alarm blared, sending knights and soldiers into action to pursue the intruders. **“Capture them!”** **“They’re over there!”** **“Alert everyone!”** The assassins moved swiftly, evading their pursuers, but some were inevitably cornered. _Slash!_ **“Ugh!”** Surrounded, the assassins were overwhelmed by the combined efforts of knights and soldiers. Despite their exceptional skills, it was impossible to fend off the sheer number of opponents. Finally, the assassins resorted to their last-ditch effort, unleashing a power entirely unsuited for stealth. _BOOOOM!_ **“Aaaaagh!”** The infiltrating assassins exploded with their life force, transforming into monstrous creatures. Those who escaped the initial assault had been the ones capable of undergoing the transformation into “Holy Warriors.” Their comrades sacrificed themselves to ensure these individuals could wreak havoc within the castle. **“Fall back! They’re Holy Warriors!”** The soldiers retreated as the knights stepped in to confront the transformed assassins. However, the empowered creatures easily overpowered them. Even with the support of the few remaining mages of Ferdium, the knights struggled to subdue the monstrous assassins. But the defenders weren’t alone. _Whoosh!_ _CRASH!_ From out of nowhere, a massive axe flew through the air, smashing the head of one rampaging assassin. **“It’s Gillian!”** A cry of relief echoed as Gillian, wearing a furious expression, charged into the fray, attacking the assassins with ferocious energy. His rage was fueled by the knowledge that his daughter Rachel was within the castle. Naturally, he fought like a mad lion. _BOOM! SMASH! CRACK!_ With Gillian leading the charge and the Fenris knights joining the battle, the Holy Warriors began to fall one by one. The overwhelming numbers left the assassins no chance of survival. Before long, the knights and soldiers of Ferdium returned in force, filling the castle. The assassins who had been discovered were all killed in a short time. Despite their exceptional skills and strength, they couldn’t overcome the sheer number of knights and soldiers. Randolph wiped the sweat from his brow and muttered, **“Is that it? Are they all dead? There aren’t any more, right?”** The bodies of eight assassins lay scattered, but Randolph tilted his head in confusion. **“Didn’t there seem to be about ten? Maybe eleven? Could some of them still be hiding?”** The knights shared uneasy glances. No additional magical alarms had been triggered, and the soldiers and knights stationed throughout the castle hadn’t found any other intruders. If the assassins had withdrawn entirely, that would at least be reassuring. But without confirmation, the castle would remain on high alert. At that moment, a wounded and breathless Belinda appeared, shouting, **“What about the young lady’s room? Rachel! What about the marquis and his retainers?”** Randolph, startled, responded, **“Belinda? What happened to you? Are you okay? Where did you get hurt?”** **“Are Rachel and the young lady safe?”** **“W-why are you talking like that…? Yes! Yes, they’re safe! There are knights and soldiers inside their room right now!”** Belinda sighed in relief, but the magical alarm rang out once more. _CLANG!_ The shattering of a window echoed through the castle. Belinda’s face turned pale. **“That’s the young lady’s room!”** _Whoosh!_ Wrapped in darkness, Belinda vanished instantly. Gillian, taken aback by the display, widened his eyes. **“She’s crossed the threshold…”** he muttered, sensing her power. But this wasn’t the time for admiration. Rachel was with Elena, and they were in danger. Gillian and the knights raced toward the room. As expected, the remaining assassins had scaled the walls to breach Elena’s room. The magical alarm had been triggered, but the assassins moved swiftly. They found two trembling women inside. One of them, a blonde-haired woman, was their primary target. **“Raaaagh!”** The assassin who broke through the window immediately transformed into a Holy Warrior and charged. Of course, the women weren’t entirely unprotected. **“Stop him!”** Four knights and dozens of soldiers surrounded them. Additional soldiers guarding the hallway burst through the door. The knights at the forefront swung their swords at the rampaging assassin. _CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!_ Their attacks were ineffective. Surprised by the monster’s resilience, the knights redoubled their efforts, pouring all their strength into their strikes. But the beastly assassin broke through with sheer force. _BOOM!_ **“Aaagh!”** The soldiers were quickly overrun, and the beast roared as it reached out toward its target. Just a little closer, and it could crush its prey’s neck. But Elena wasn’t protected by the knights alone. _SHING!_ Eight maids descended from the ceiling, intercepting the monster’s path. These weren’t ordinary maids but assassins trained by Ghislain and Belinda. _CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!_ They restrained the Holy Warrior with steel wires connected to their daggers, attacking with precise strikes. The knights, regaining their composure, mustered their mana and slashed at the creature’s back. _Slash! Slash! Slash!_ Under the relentless assault, the monster’s body quickly turned into a tattered mess. But it wasn’t alone. **“Raaaagh!”** Another assassin-turned-Holy Warrior charged in. Having faced one already, the knights and maids unleashed their full strength, holding their ground. After subduing the second attacker, everyone momentarily relaxed. _SHING!_ In that brief moment, a third assassin shot forward. **“Stop him!”** The knights swung their swords and the maids hurled daggers, but none of the attacks were lethal. Wounded but undeterred, the assassin reached his target. He had taken advantage of his comrades’ sacrifices to create this opening. As the assassin reached out toward Elena, Rachel threw herself in front of her. **“Rachel!”** Hearing Elena’s scream, Rachel closed her eyes. **“Tch!”** The assassin hesitated briefly, shifting his attention. The maids took the opportunity to close in. Forced to act, the assassin grabbed Rachel by the neck. **“Don’t move!”** The assassin snarled, tightening his grip. While unsure if this hostage would work, he avoided using his poisoned dagger, just in case. Everyone froze. Even if Rachel wasn’t the marquis’s daughter, she was still an important figure in Feridium. The gamble worked. The assassin held Rachel tightly, his breath ragged. **“Step back. If you don’t want her to die, move.”** The soldiers and knights retreated cautiously. Watching their reaction, the assassin hesitated. **‘Damn it. She’s not the target, but she’s important enough. If I can buy time until the master arrives…’** He clung to the hope that Melkir would arrive, creating chaos to fulfill their mission. Just then, Ghislain entered the room. **“Duke! My lord!”** The room erupted in murmurs as everyone turned toward the new arrival. The assassin’s eyes widened as he realized who had just entered. Ghislain, exuding an icy aura, spoke calmly. **“Release her if you want to die peacefully. Unless you want your head smashed like your master’s.”** **“What? The master… is dead?”** **“Yes.”** The assassin’s face contorted in disbelief. **“Lies! There’s no way! The master was a transcendent! How can you stand here so casually?”** Ghislain smirked and gestured toward Belinda. **“She’s the one who killed him.”** Seeing Belinda covered in wounds, the assassin gulped. He still couldn’t fully believe it, but if it were true, he was as good as dead. **“So, what’s it going to be? A quick death or a painful one?”** Ghislain began spreading invisible threads of mana, preparing for a critical strike. As everyone held their breath, ready to pounce, an unexpected voice broke the tension. **“Let Rachel go!”** It was Elena. She lunged forward, grabbing the assassin’s arm with surprising speed. Distracted, the assassin shifted his focus. But before he could retaliate, Rachel’s grip on his arm tightened, and a sharp _CRACK!_ echoed as the bone in his arm snapped. **“Aagh!”** The assassin screamed in pain, his control over the situation shattered. Taking advantage of the moment, Ghislain’s mana-threaded shard struck with pinpoint precision. _SHUNK!_ The fragment pierced through the assassin’s skull, silencing him instantly. At the same time, the knights and maids launched their attacks, slashing, stabbing, and overwhelming him with a barrage of strikes. _SLASH! THUD! RIP!_ The assassin’s body was torn apart in seconds, his monstrous form collapsing lifelessly onto the floor. _THUD!_ The room fell silent, but the tension lingered. No one cheered or celebrated. Instead, all eyes turned toward Elena, disbelief painted on their faces. Even Elena herself looked stunned, staring at her hands as if they belonged to someone else. It was Ghislain who broke the silence, his voice hesitant and almost incredulous. **“E-Elena… you…”** **“Huh? W-what?”** Elena stammered, blinking rapidly as she tried to comprehend what had just happened. **“Did you… did you just… break his arm?”** Elena looked at her hands again, her mouth opening and closing in confusion. **“I-I don’t know… I didn’t mean to… I just grabbed him, and…”** Rachel, who had been freed from the assassin’s grasp, rubbed her sore neck and looked at Elena with wide eyes. **“Elena… Have you been working out or something?”** The unexpected question broke the tension in the room. Several knights coughed awkwardly, while some of the maids exchanged puzzled looks. Elena’s face turned bright red as she waved her hands frantically. **“N-no! I swear, I haven’t! I don’t even—how could I—”** Before she could finish, Rachel grabbed her friend’s hands and held them tightly. **“You saved me, Elena. Don’t sell yourself short.”** Tears welled in Rachel’s eyes as she smiled. Elena, flustered and unsure, looked around the room, hoping someone would explain what had just happened. Ghislain, observing the scene, frowned slightly. His sharp gaze swept over Elena, as if trying to uncover a hidden secret. **“Elena,”** he said slowly, his tone serious. **“That strength… it wasn’t normal. Are you sure you haven’t been training?”** Elena shook her head emphatically, her voice shaky. **“No! I haven’t done anything like that!”** Ghislain remained silent for a moment before finally letting out a sigh. **“Well, whatever it was, you saved Rachel. That’s what matters.”** The group quickly resumed their focus, inspecting the room and securing the area. Despite the strange occurrence, the danger hadn’t entirely passed. But as they worked, Elena couldn’t help but glance down at her hands, still unsure of what had just happened. Deep inside, something stirred—a faint, unexplainable feeling that refused to fade.
