Ghislain's mobile unit currently consisted of 10,000 soldiers. While 20,000 troops had been allocated to Marquis Maurice McQuarry’s side, Ghislain decided to pick the most elite 10,000 to prioritize speed and execute his plan swiftly. _Thud, thud, thud, thud!_ The 10,000-strong Fenris mobile unit moved at an extraordinary pace. The only times they stopped were when their horses needed rest. The robust northern horses, known for their stamina, required only brief periods of rest. Moreover, the highly nutritious combat rations from Fenris further minimized the time needed for recuperation. _Thud, thud, thud, thud!_ This was Ghislain, who had traversed the kingdom as if it were his backyard. The mobile unit, traversing familiar terrain with no hesitation, soon caught up with the Delphine forces led by Count Fograne. Dark, who had been trailing the Delphine army, sent an update through their mental link. — _They’re pushing forward diligently._ Ghislain looked up at the sky. There was still some time left before nightfall. “Good. They won’t expect us to arrive this quickly.” It was reasonable to think so. Logically, no one would anticipate that the Northern Army, fresh from battle, would already be on the move again. Even the messenger sent by the defeated Count Mathes hadn’t yet reached the other battalions. The Fenris mobile unit was moving faster than any messenger could. “Everyone, rest up now. We’ll be moving through the night.” The mobile unit, which had been advancing without rest for several days, collapsed where they stood as soon as Ghislain gave the command. Even for such well-trained soldiers, this forced march was grueling. They didn’t bother setting up a proper camp. They simply tied up their horses and took a break wherever they stood. Of course, they didn’t just lay there idly. Fenris now had an abundance of supplies, including potions. “Ha, it really is good to have money.” “Never thought I’d drink one of these when I wasn’t injured.” “This stuff used to be so expensive we couldn’t even think about buying it.” Each soldier pulled out a potion from their pack and drank it. Potions not only healed wounds but also boosted vitality by artificially enhancing regeneration. It was akin to pouring liquid gold into their mouths, but none of them cared. Thanks to the overwhelming production volume, every soldier carried a surplus of potions. Though discipline and training were strict, Ghislain always ensured his soldiers received the best treatment. As a result, their morale continued to rise with each battle, seemingly without limit. _Whooosh..._ As the surroundings grew dim and a chilly wind began to blow, Dark reported again through their mental link. — _Just as you said, their pace is slowing._ “Everyone, mount up.” Without a word of complaint, the soldiers climbed onto their horses at Ghislain’s command. “We move now.” As Ghislain spurred his legendary steed, the Black King, the mobile unit followed close behind. Dark provided updates through the link again. — _They’re starting to halt their advance from the front lines._ “Accelerate!” _Thud, thud, thud, thud!_ The pace quickened. Nothing obstructed their advance. This was no coincidence. Ghislain had chosen their staging point with care. The enemy wasn’t foolish and would undoubtedly deploy scouts, covering a wide area. To avoid detection, Ghislain had chosen a location far enough away but with terrain that allowed for uninterrupted movement. — _They’re starting to set up their encampment._ “Faster!” Ghislain shouted, his lips curling into a ferocious grin. A dark aura began to ripple around the Black King. _Neigh!_ The Black King let out a long, resonant cry and shot forward like a streak of light. Though the distance between Ghislain and his troops widened, it didn’t matter. It was always Ghislain’s role to be the first to arrive at the most dangerous location. _Thud, thud, thud!_ Behind him, the mobile unit pushed their horses even harder, pouring every ounce of strength into the charge. Their mindset was always the same: fight as if this were the last battle. This allowed them to unleash their full power in every charge. Despite their skill, building an encampment for an army of 30,000 would inevitably take time. Once the encampment was completed, Count Fograne spoke to his aide. “Reports indicate that a superhuman may have joined Marquis McQuarry’s forces. Stay vigilant, as they might launch a surprise attack given their lack of manpower.” “Understood.” “Also, set up stakes and bladed traps around the encampment.” Even after a victory, Count Fograne, as an excellent commander, did not let down his guard. The soldiers, exhausted from marching, looked forward to resting once the encampment was finished. However, upon receiving the order to set traps, many of them grumbled quietly. Even so, they were disciplined elite troops and immediately began their work. “Let’s get this done quickly and rest!” Guards began to reinforce their posts, while others moved to relieve soldiers for rotation. As the soldiers dug and hammered stakes into the ground, their vigilance started to waver slightly, creating the perfect opening. _Thud, thud..._ Some of the soldiers heard the faint sound of hooves and raised their heads. The noise wasn’t loud, leading them to assume it was just a messenger. “Is that a courier?” Their expressions quickly shifted from curiosity to horror. _Thud, thud, thud, thud!_ The single sound of hooves was swallowed by the thunderous rumble of an entire cavalry unit. The noise grew louder, closing the distance rapidly. Though it wasn’t yet fully dark, a knight with sharp vision spotted the glint of a spear in the hand of the approaching rider. “Enemy! The enemy is here!” “Grab your weapons!” “Form ranks!” The camp descended into chaos. Soldiers who had been setting traps dropped their tools and scrambled for their weapons. It wasn’t that they were unprepared. They followed the proper battle protocols and didn’t neglect their duties. But Ghislain had struck at the perfect moment, exploiting the smallest cracks in their defenses. Ghislain pulled his spear back, dark energy coursing through it as it vibrated ominously. “Let’s have some fun.” With those words, Ghislain’s crimson eyes gleamed, and he hurled the spear. _BOOOM!_ The mana-infused spear shot forward like a missile, detonating with a massive shockwave. The soldiers in its immediate vicinity didn’t even have time to scream as their bodies were torn apart. Still, the 30,000-strong army was vast, and Ghislain’s attack had only taken out a fraction of their numbers. _Neigh!_ The Black King let out another deafening cry, charging headlong into the disoriented Delphine camp. Grabbing a spare spear from the saddle, Ghislain grinned. “Perfect.” The enemy soldiers were still reeling in confusion. This was the perfect opportunity to press the attack before they could regroup. Until the rest of the mobile unit arrived, it was Ghislain’s job to keep the enemy off balance. “Let’s go!” The dark aura around the Black King flared as dozens of magical spears materialized around Ghislain. _FWOOOOSH!_ The spears shot outward, piercing through enemy ranks with devastating precision. “Argh!” “Stop him! Stop him now!” “Form ranks immediately!” The chaotic sounds of combat erupted as Ghislain and the Black King rampaged through the camp, decimating enemy forces. Officers shouted commands, but the disorganized soldiers couldn’t hear or follow orders amidst the chaos. Whenever they tried to regroup, another magical spear would tear through their ranks, plunging them back into disarray. “Who the hell is attacking us?!” “Everyone, gather! Regroup now!” “Dammit! What kind of monster is this?!” The soldiers couldn’t fathom that their attacker was Count Fenris himself. It seemed impossible. Yet despite their shock and confusion, the 30,000-strong army began to form ranks on the outskirts of the camp, while those near the center quickly surrounded their commander. _Clang! Clang! Clang!_ Around Count Fograne, mages gathered, their spells ready. Knights raised their shields, creating a protective formation around him. Elite soldiers, the best of the Delphine forces, closed ranks, determined to protect their leader. Fograne barked orders in frustration. “What the hell were you doing on watch? The enemy is already here! Who is it? Who’s attacking us?!” “Sir, it’s... it’s one man. We haven’t identified him yet...” Darkness continued to envelop the area, making it difficult to see clearly. The attacker’s silhouette was shrouded in a black aura, further obscuring his identity. Only two entities were known for wielding such dark energy: the priests of the Salvation Order and Count Fenris himself. But the notion that Count Fenris would attack them alone was too absurd for them to consider. “Stop him! Stop him now!” “Don’t worry, sir! He caught us off guard, but our forces will surround and crush him soon—” The knight’s report was abruptly cut off. _THUD, THUD, THUD, THUD!_ The ground quaked violently, heralding the approach of countless cavalrymen. The thunderous noise signaled the arrival of a massive force. “What... what is this...?” Before the Delphine forces could fully assess the situation, 10,000 mounted Fenris soldiers descended upon their encampment. _BOOOOOOM!_ “Arghhh!” The soldiers, who had barely begun forming ranks, screamed as they were mercilessly cut down. The Delphine forces were neither mounted nor properly organized to withstand the sudden cavalry assault. It was impossible for them to repel such an overwhelming charge. Fires erupted across the encampment. The Fenris cavalry massacred the Delphine soldiers, spreading chaos in their wake. “What… what is this…?” Count Fograne stared in disbelief at the scene unfolding before his eyes. Every precaution had been taken. They were even preparing traps to counter a possible night raid. Yet the enemy had exploited the brief window when they were most vulnerable, delivering a perfectly executed ambush. To achieve this, the attackers would have needed to track their position in real time, evade the scouts' detection, and perfectly calculate their distance and timing. It was an impossible feat. The only explanation seemed to be sheer luck. Then, suddenly, Count Fograne recalled someone infamous for such mobility and precision. “No… it can’t be…” It made no sense. There was no way this person could have arrived in time. But if it wasn’t him, none of this could be explained. The remnants of Marquis McQuarry’s defeated forces could not have mounted such an assault. A lone figure, wielding a spear and wreaking havoc amidst countless enemies. A massive black horse shrouded in dark energy. Spears of magical energy raining down from all directions. The kingdom’s universally acknowledged strongest warrior of the North. “Count Fenris!” At the sound of Count Fograne’s panicked scream, Ghislain responded with a smirk. “That’s right. I am Count Fenris.” _FWOOOOM!_ Ghislain charged toward Count Fograne with lightning speed. Even with the ambush, 30,000 soldiers were still a massive force. If they resisted long enough, Ghislain’s forces would inevitably suffer heavy casualties. The most pressing concern was the Sixth-Circle mages. Their destructive capabilities were significant. Ghislain needed to focus their attention entirely on him. As expected, Count Fograne pointed directly at him and shouted. “Kill him! Everyone, attack that man! If he dies, this war is ours!” Count Fograne couldn’t fathom how Fenris had defeated the Second Corps so quickly or arrived here at this perfect moment. But one thing was clear. Even if every soldier here perished, Count Fenris had to die. “But, Commander… there are too many of our own troops around him. If we use magic now—” One of the mages hesitated, pointing out the risk of collateral damage. Fenris was a Master, after all. Only the most powerful spells could harm him, but such spells would inevitably affect their allies. Fograne, however, grabbed the mage by the collar and roared in frustration. “Do it now! Kill him this instant! If we let him go, we’re all dead anyway!” The Delphine forces were already losing momentum, their formations collapsing. The Fenris cavalry was decimating the encampment with unmatched speed and precision. _BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!_ Ghislain cut through the soldiers surrounding him as he advanced toward Count Fograne. The knights encircling Count Fograne didn’t pose much of a challenge, clearing a path for Ghislain to close in. For now, he had to keep the enemy’s focus entirely on him. _BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!_ “Arghhh!” Watching their comrades being swept aside, the mages steeled themselves. Count Fograne was right. There was no room for hesitation. If they couldn’t kill this monster here and now, they were doomed. _WHOOOOM!_ Two Sixth-Circle mages, six Fifth-Circle mages, and over fifty lower-ranking mages began pooling their mana. _RUMBLE!_ Sixth-Circle magic was a step below the power of Seventh-Circle “superhumans,” but it was still potent enough to change the course of a battle. Though they lacked the numbers of the Second Corps, the Delphine forces still had two Sixth-Circle mages, six Fifth-Circle mages, and an additional fifty combat mages present. These mages were prepared to unleash devastating spells, even if it meant sacrificing their own soldiers, to bring down their target. All their mana concentrated on one person. Feeling the overwhelming surge of energy gathering around him, Ghislain tightened his grip on the Black King’s reins. “Kong, hold strong,” he murmured to his steed. _FWOOOSH!_ Ghislain’s entire body became enveloped in pitch-black energy. Within the darkness, his crimson eyes glowed fiercely. _NEIGH!_ The Black King, too, became shrouded in the dark aura, its eyes gleaming red alongside its master. And then, all at once, the mages unleashed their spells. _BOOOOOOOM!_ The countless magical attacks struck Ghislain directly, exploding with catastrophic force.
