_"Lead us!"_ _"Take the throne!"_ _"Drive out the Salvation Order and save this kingdom!"_ The fervent cries of the crowd left Zvalter stunned. _"T-This is…"_ Even before reaching the capital, nearly everyone they encountered had joined him, forming a growing throng of hopeful citizens. Though he had resolved to take the throne, the sheer openness and fervor of the people’s demand overwhelmed him. _"What is happening here? We heard Ghislain had secured the capital, but no one mentioned it was in this state."_ The nobles and soldiers accompanying Zvalter shared his confusion. They had been briefed on the fall of the capital and the death of the king, but this level of public enthusiasm was unexpected. The people’s joy was understandable—the tyrant was gone—but the united, spontaneous demand for Zvalter to ascend the throne caught everyone off guard. _"How will the other nobles and lords perceive this?"_ Zvalter murmured. While many nobles had joined his cause to end the king’s tyranny, none had yet pledged their support for him as king. Zvalter’s declarations had focused on restoring justice and reestablishing the council, not seizing the throne. _"I intended to follow proper procedures…"_ As Zvalter struggled to find the right words, his advisor, Claude, stepped forward with a reassuring tone. _"My lord, the people are overcome with excitement. Allow me to address them briefly and calm their spirits."_ Zvalter nodded hesitantly. Claude stepped forward, cleared his throat, and raised his voice. _"I am Claude, steward of the Fenris estate and advisor to Marquis Ferdium!"_ The mention of "Fenris" drew an immediate roar of approval. _"The hardships you’ve endured under the tyrant’s oppression are not unknown to us! It was to liberate you, the people, that Marquis Ferdium sent Lord Ghislain ahead to rid us of the king!"_ _"Hurrah for Lord Ghislain!"_ _"He ended the tyrant’s reign!"_ _"Long live the Fenris family!"_ Encouraged by the crowd's reaction, Claude continued. _"And who is the father of Lord Ghislain, the hero who delivered you?"_ _"Marquis Ferdium!"_ _"Who was the only noble to raise an army to save this kingdom while others cowered in fear?"_ _"Marquis Ferdium!"_ _"Exactly! It was Marquis Ferdium who risked everything to protect this nation and its people!"_ The crowd’s cheers grew louder. Zvalter, watching from behind, blinked in surprise. What was meant to calm the crowd had escalated into outright fervor. People were standing, shouting, and waving their hands in jubilation. Claude, however, had no intention of slowing down. _"Let me ask again! When all other nobles hid and turned their backs, who alone showed courage and led his army for the sake of the people?"_ _"Marquis Ferdium!"_ _"Then who deserves to sit upon the throne and be called the true king of this kingdom?"_ _"Marquis Ferdium!"_ Claude thrust his hand into the air dramatically. _"Then it is decided! Marquis Ferdium will ascend as the new king of Ruthania!"_ _"Hurrah! Long live Marquis Ferdium!"_ The crowd erupted into deafening cheers. Claude's fiery words left no room for doubt—Zvalter was their king in spirit, if not yet in title. Zvalter wiped the sweat from his brow, his gaze narrowing at Claude. The man had turned a political announcement into a grand festival. Around him, even the Fenris soldiers and knights were grinning and celebrating alongside the crowd. Ghislain, observing with amusement, nudged Porisco. _"Now would be a good time for the church to weigh in."_ Porisco caught the hint immediately and rushed forward. _"Hear me, people of Ruthania! I am Porisco, High Priest of the Four Great Orders and your ‘Saint’!"_ _"Saint Porisco!"_ The crowd’s cheers surged anew. _"On behalf of the church, I, Porisco, declare Marquis Ferdium the rightful heir to the throne! This is not only my will as High Priest but also the will of the Goddess herself! Anyone who opposes this decision stands against the divine!"_ _"Hurrah for Marquis Ferdium!"_ _"Long live the king!"_ Porisco seized the opportunity to repeatedly emphasize his titles of "High Priest" and "Saint," further solidifying his newfound prestige. Faced with the unfolding spectacle, Zvalter could only chuckle wryly. _"I suppose I should have expected this with Ghislain involved. Nothing ever goes by the book with him."_ While Zvalter knew he would need to seek formal approval from the other nobles, he doubted there would be much resistance. After all, few would dare to oppose a leader so beloved by the people. Zvalter sighed deeply, a faint smile playing on his lips. Once a poor frontier lord, he now stood on the brink of becoming king. Finally, he stepped forward, his voice steady but humble. _"I am but a simple man, one who can only serve by standing alongside you. But if it is your will…"_ The crowd fell silent, hanging on his every word. Zvalter smiled warmly, his tone resolute. _"Then I will take the throne of this kingdom."_ The roar of approval that followed was deafening. Belinda wiped away tears as she watched the scene unfold. _"You’re crying again? You’ve been so emotional lately,"_ Ghislain teased. _"How could I not cry? After all he’s endured, he’s finally becoming king. I only wish Lady Annette could see this."_ _"Didn’t you oppose their marriage back then?"_ _"At first, yes. Honestly, what was there to like about him? He was poor, not much of a fighter, and not from a prestigious family."_ Belinda recalled her younger self, grumbling to Annette. _"What do you even see in him? He’s broke, weak, and not even handsome."_ Annette had only smiled gently. _"There’s more to a person than what’s on the surface. He’s a good man."_ It had taken years, but Belinda finally understood. Zvalter’s character—the way he treated all people with fairness and kindness, his unwavering dedication to his land and his people—was what set him apart. Now, as he marched toward the throne, Belinda knew Annette must be smiling down on him. Zvalter and the Ferdium forces advanced toward the palace with purpose. Though the coronation would have to wait, there was much to address—the shattered kingdom, the looming threat of the Ducal House’s army, and the rebuilding of trust. _"Lower taxes and distribute food freely. Inform the nobles that they must align with us for now; disputes can be addressed later."_ While Zvalter’s declaration had won the people, formal agreements with the nobles were still pending. Any rebellion would only strengthen the Ducal House’s hand. Fortunately, the nobles of the capital began to show their support. _"The Marquis of Branford has declared his backing for the new king!"_ _"The Marquis of McQuarry has issued a similar statement!"_ _"Counts Ailesbur and Norton have also pledged their allegiance!"_ The leading nobles of the kingdom, as if in unison, issued statements of support simultaneously. Of course, they did not directly step forward to declare their allegiance. Rather, they released statements through their representatives. Even so, this act alone provided significant strength. As long as the church and the influential nobles in the capital supported the cause, it would be difficult for provincial nobles to express dissatisfaction. Thanks to this, Zvalter managed to catch a brief respite, but his troubles were far from over. “Hmm, there’s just so much to do.” Managing a remote territory was vastly different from running an entire kingdom. The finances were in shambles, largely due to how much the nobles who had served the previous king had plundered. This was where Ghislain stepped in to provide assistance. “We’re currently rounding up all those who fled with their stolen wealth. Fenris will continue to send reinforcements. As for replacing the administrators, you can rely on Claude's help for that.” “Yes, stability must come quickly if the lives of the people are to improve.” “Count Ailesbur and Lady Branford will also assist in managing state affairs.” After the king's execution, Ghislain's first order of business was to meet Rosalyn and Mariel. Both greeted him warmly, overjoyed by the success. The abilities of these two women had already been proven. They would be instrumental in stabilizing the kingdom. “For now, entrust the financial management to them. Under no circumstances should you leave it to Claude.” “…Understood.” Support would also come from Ferdium. Albert was set to take on the role of royal treasurer, but Mariel and Rosalyn would share the position as joint treasurers to ensure effective management. As for non-financial matters, Claude’s experience in running Fenris would be invaluable. Though it would take some time, the kingdom would eventually stabilize. Having roughly addressed the most pressing issues, Ghislain spoke to Zvalter. “I’ll be taking my leave now. The battles on the southern front are growing fiercer.” Zvalter’s expression grew concerned at his words. “Be careful.” “Don’t worry. This time, I’ll make sure it’s finished once and for all.” Ghislain gave a confident smile. The Northern Army was currently engaged in fierce battles against the Duke’s forces on the southern front. He needed to join them as quickly as possible. If the Duke’s faction could be eliminated, the Ruthania Kingdom would soon find stability. After that, all that would remain would be to root out the scattered remnants of the Salvation Order across the continent. Zvalter nodded solemnly. “Very well. Depart immediately. The Ferdium forces and the royal army will follow closely behind.” There were no longer any threats to the capital. Zvalter planned to leave only a minimal force for maintaining security, sending the majority of his troops to the southern front. To avoid slowing the overall movement, Ghislain and the mobile forces would advance first, as they had done before. As they departed, the people of the capital erupted in cheers. “Lead us to victory again!” “Drive out the Duke’s faction and the Salvation Order!” “Goddess, bless the Fenris Army!” Amid the fervent cheers of the citizens, Ghislain and the mobile forces raced toward the southern front like a storm. Simultaneously, the Ferdium forces and the royal army, led by Randolph, began their march southward. *** The Western Army and the Allied Forces were gathered at a fortress on the southern front, awaiting orders. Their mission was to join the Northern Army and halt the Duke’s advancing forces. The overall commander of the southern front was Gillian, as he was the most experienced and suitable for the role. For the Duke’s faction, this was an opportunity they could not afford to miss. Striking the Royal Army from the rear while they were engaged with the Ferdium forces would deal a devastating blow. Allowing the Royal Army, their future obstacle, to be annihilated was also not an option. Upon hearing that the Ferdium forces and the Fenris mobile troops were heading for the capital, the Duke’s faction immediately mobilized 200,000 soldiers and began marching north. The armies clashed the moment they met. The Delphine forces, led by the Kingdom’s foremost swordsman, were far stronger than any opponents faced before. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** Magic and trebuchet stones rained down relentlessly from both sides. The Salvation Order’s superhumans launched wide-scale aerial attacks, devastating the battlefield. Even with Vanessa, a 7th-Circle mage, and hundreds of other mages working together, it was impossible to completely neutralize the enemy’s magic. “Hold the line! We can stop them!” Under Gillian’s command, the soldiers fought valiantly. The combined forces of the Southern Army amounted to 200,000 as well. With evenly matched numbers, the Duke’s faction couldn’t break through easily. Although the Salvation Order’s priests allowed the enemy to field more superhumans, each superhuman in the Northern Army was overwhelmingly powerful. As the battle dragged on, casualties mounted on both sides. The poorly trained Western Army and Allied Forces suffered the heaviest losses. While Gillian grew increasingly frustrated by the escalating casualties, Kaien, who led the Delphine forces, was deep in thought. “If the Count of Fenris is directly involved, the Royal Army won’t be able to stop him.” Count Phalantz had to remain to protect the royal capital. The Royal Army alone would struggle to handle the sudden movements of the Ferdium forces and the Fenris mobile troops. To hold them back, the entire Royal Army would need to unite, but it was unlikely they would act decisively in time. As more time passed, news spread that the Royal Army was surrendering en masse to the Ferdium forces. “This is bad…” Kaien gritted his teeth. The Royal Army’s strength was steadily transferring to the opposing side. If those troops all converged on the southern front, even if they managed to win, their own losses would be catastrophic. Then came more troubling news. “The lords… are coming here, not to the capital?” “Yes, it seems they’ve received a summons from the Marquis of Ferdium and decided to join him. They’ve been requested to help hold this line.” The implication was clear: reinforcements were arriving for the opposing side, while their own losses continued to mount. If this trend continued, the tide of battle might shift against them. Still, retreating now would mean switching to a defensive posture, a situation they couldn’t afford. **‘We just need to break through before the Count of Fenris arrives.’** If they could achieve that, dealing with the rest would be much easier. “We’ll have to take some risks and end this quickly.” While Kaien wrestled with his decision, the Northern Army’s morale soared. They welcomed the arriving forces from the lords with open arms. With each reinforcement, holding the line became increasingly feasible. Of course, not all arrivals were welcomed without scrutiny. Gillian, exuding a sharp aura, carefully observed the approaching troops, biting his lip imperceptibly to keep his emotions in check. He nodded slightly toward the figure leading the vanguard on horseback. “You’ve arrived.” “Yes, it’s been a while,” Amelia replied, making no effort to hide her irritation. Behind her, 50,000 Rayfold troops stood at the ready. Gillian remained on edge, knowing full well why Amelia was displeased. It was clear that Ghislain had once again forced her hand with a mix of threats and persuasion to bring her here.
