The Cyclops is nothing short of a legendary creature. While it exists in reality, spotting one is nearly impossible due to its rarity. Its strength and size rival any monster, surpassed only by dragons. So, what would happen if someone managed to slay such a beast single-handedly? _"Then I’ll be known as the 'Cyclops Slayer'!"_ Kaor, already bearing titles like _Ogre Slayer_ and _King of Northern Hides_ , had once felt satisfied with his accolades. But now, as a superhuman, those titles felt insufficient. He craved something more striking, more profound. The Cyclops was the perfect opportunity to quench that desire. Even if _Dragon Slayer_ was out of reach, _Cyclops Slayer_ seemed achievable. Boom! Boom! Boom! The Cyclops swung its massive club relentlessly at Kaor, its frustration mounting with every missed strike. Kaor, with his keen combat instincts and knack for exploiting weaknesses, moved nimbly to evade its attacks. As he dodged, he seized every opening to dart in and slash with his dual swords. Shhk! Shhk! True to his self-proclaimed "double attack power," the Cyclops's lower body bore countless slash marks. Kaor targeted the tendons around the Cyclops’s ankles. It was basic knowledge for dealing with massive monsters—take out their mobility first. Shhk! Shhk! Kaor’s swords moved with lightning speed, his relentless focus on crippling the Cyclops. Since becoming a superhuman, his movements had evolved. While they still appeared wild and savage, they now carried a sharpness rivaling even Ghislain’s. Shhk! Shhk! Shhk! Shhk! With methodical precision, Kaor continued to strike at the Cyclops’s ankles. Though it would take time, he was confident he could bring it down. Those watching Kaor’s steady performance hesitated to intervene. Gordon turned to Lukas beside him. "Shouldn’t we jump in? He looks like he can handle it, but it’s taking too long." Lukas frowned. "It’d be faster if we just killed it together." "But you know how he gets." "Yeah, no kidding. If only he had half the humility of Gillian." Both men shook their heads in exasperation. The other knights shared their sentiments. Gillian, devoid of unnecessary pride, focused solely on achieving Ghislain’s goals. He never hesitated to collaborate with allies, valuing efficiency over personal glory. Kaor, however, was different. His craving for recognition was insatiable. Everyone familiar with Kaor’s obstinate personality stood back, unsure how to handle him. Even Belinda, who had returned after supporting Ghislain, clicked her tongue in disapproval. "Why’s he still like that, even as a superhuman?" Ghislain chuckled at the sight, finding it amusing. That personality would never change. When Kaor had ascended to superhuman status, Ghislain had been overjoyed and celebrated his achievement. But Kaor, emboldened by his newfound power, had foolishly challenged Ghislain to a duel—and predictably, ended up beaten to a pulp. Perhaps his humiliation during that bout drove him to seek redemption today by slaying the Cyclops and earning widespread recognition. Boom! Boom! Boom! Kaor dodged the Cyclops’s massive club with intense focus. _"I’ll kill it. I’ll be the one to take it down. Even the old man couldn’t do this—only I can!"_ If he succeeded, he’d prove himself superior to his mentor. Kaor’s mind was consumed by this singular desire. What was the point of becoming a superhuman if he couldn’t rise above the other elites in Fenris? His inferiority complex hadn’t diminished, despite his new status. For Kaor, this wasn’t about the grandeur of a superhuman lifestyle. It was a matter of pride. His determination drove his focus to extraordinary levels, as if propelled by sheer willpower. Shhk! Shhk! Shhk! The Cyclops’s ankles were now deeply slashed, the bones beginning to show. Roar! The Cyclops let out a pained cry and finally collapsed to its knees. Now Kaor could start circling it, targeting its arms and torso. _"I can do this!"_ Though exhausted and with half his mana depleted, Kaor felt confident. At this rate, victory was inevitable. It would take time, but he’d triumph in the end. Shhk! Shhk! Shhk! Kaor pressed on, attacking with a level of focus he had never shown before. The Cyclops’s movements grew slower and more sluggish, while Kaor’s heart raced with excitement. _"Just a little more!"_ His body felt lighter, as though a surge of energy was reinvigorating him. Roar! The Cyclops swung its club toward Kaor with a desperate, sweeping motion. Boom! The ground shook and cracked, but Kaor dodged nimbly, his eyes glinting with anticipation. _"Now’s my chance!"_ Kaor dashed forward, confident he could strike a decisive blow. With a victorious grin, he gripped his swords tightly. Watching from a distance, Ghislain clicked his tongue. "Here we go again." The battle isn’t over until it’s truly over. It was clear that Kaor was overexcited, believing the fight was already won. Such moments were always the most dangerous. The Cyclops wasn’t an unintelligent beast. True to form, the Cyclops suddenly swung its club sideways in a sweeping arc. "Huh?" Kaor froze, startled. The attack deviated entirely from its usual pattern. The enormous club, large enough to block his vision, came hurtling toward him at a speed that left no room to dodge. Kaor’s instincts screamed at him. He poured his remaining mana into reinforcing his body. _"I’m dead if this hits me!"_ It was a moment of pure survival instinct. Jerome and Vanessa reacted instantly, throwing up shields around Kaor. Julien slashed at the Cyclops’s arm to weaken the attack. Their swift, precise actions mitigated the impact, but everyone was drained and exhausted. It wasn’t enough to stop the Cyclops’s overwhelming force entirely. Boom! "Argh!" Crunch! The club struck Kaor, shattering his arm and ribs. Even with the combined shields and weakened attack, the damage was severe. As Kaor reeled from the blow, his mind flashed with memories. _"…This feels just like back then…"_ He recalled a similar near-death experience while fighting the Twin-Headed Ogre. But this time, it was worse. One side of his body felt completely broken. Even without further injuries, he doubted he could survive much longer. _"…I’m screwed."_ Kaor’s mind blurred with pain, regret washing over him as he realized he had overestimated himself. If he collapsed now, he wouldn’t even have the strength to dodge the follow-up attacks. As such thoughts filled his head, his body was flung violently into the distance. "Kaaaargh!" The Cyclops let out a triumphant roar. Despite some interference, it had finally landed a solid blow on that pesky human. If the strike had hit directly, the human would’ve been obliterated in one shot. That was its only regret. But it didn’t matter. The human was lying on the ground, unable to move. Now, it would finish the job. The Cyclops turned its massive body toward the downed Kaor. Though the human had been flung quite far, it would only take a few steps to crush him entirely. Its gaze also swept over the other humans in the vicinity. It intended to wipe them all out. "Kaaaargh!" The Cyclops raised its upper body high. Its movements were labored, but killing the humans before it would not be difficult. Kaor, lying in a crumpled heap, whispered through gritted teeth, his face contorted in pain. “Help… me…” “…” The people who heard him looked at him with disdain. Kaor was, after all, still Kaor. While the Cyclops was undoubtedly a formidable monster, the battlefield was teeming with seasoned warriors. The remaining monsters had already been largely cleared out, with the fortress’s troops finishing off the stragglers. At Kaor’s pitiful plea for help, everyone except Ghislain moved at once. Boom! The first strike came in the form of a magical bombardment that slammed into the Cyclops’s body. Following it, Julien and Gillian’s swords and Belinda’s daggers sliced into the monster relentlessly. "Kaaaargh!" The Cyclops swung its club wildly in pain, but none of the attackers were hit. Coordinated assaults from all sides quickly left the creature heaving and gasping, its movements slowing down. Taking advantage of this, the entire Fenris Knight Order surged forward. Thunk! Slash! Bang! "Kaaaaah…" Thud! It didn’t take long for the Cyclops to collapse, its massive body reduced to little more than a pulverized heap. Kaor’s earlier efforts had worn it down, but the combined skill and numbers of the others ensured the fight ended swiftly. Sitting on the ground, watching the scene unfold, Ghislain let out a laugh. “Finally, it’s done. Good work, everyone.” His words brought a wave of cheers from the troops, their triumphant cries echoing across the battlefield. "Yaaaaaah!" "We won!" "We're alive! We actually survived this!" The fortress troops rejoiced wholeheartedly. Having narrowly escaped death, their relief and joy were palpable. However, the pure joy didn’t last long. Before long, many began mourning their fallen comrades. This monster wave had been nothing short of a nightmare. None of them ever wanted to experience it again. The Marquis of Alpheren arrived alongside several priests, shouting as he approached. "Your Grace! Are you alright?" The priests surrounded Ghislain, their hands glowing with divine energy as they worked to heal him. Ghislain waved them off with a smile. "I'm always fine. Go tend to that guy first." He gestured toward Kaor, who was being carried away on a stretcher. Kaor had failed to earn the title or fame he had so desperately desired. All he’d gained was another round of humiliation. The priests hurried over, using their divine power to stabilize Kaor. The man buried his face in the stretcher, clearly unwilling to show his face. Belinda, walking beside the stretcher, clicked her tongue in disapproval. "If you’re embarrassed, you shouldn’t have acted like that in the first place." "…" Kaor remained silent, refusing to lift his head. Yet, the area around his buried face appeared suspiciously damp. Alfoy, ever the instigator, smirked and prodded. "Hey, is this guy crying? Are you crying?" "…" Kaor responded only by angrily waving a hand, signaling them to hurry and move along. The soldiers carrying the stretcher quickened their pace, while Alfoy followed, continuing to taunt him. "Come on, admit it! You’re crying, aren’t you?" "…" Kaor remained silent, his face buried firmly in the stretcher. Once Ghislain had received basic treatment and stood up, the Marquis of Alpheren approached him again. "You’ve done enough, Your Grace. You should rest and tend to your wounds." Ghislain shook his head. "We need to move to the next location immediately. We can rest while traveling." "But the troops are exhausted…" "This is the frontline fortress. It was the first to be attacked. Other fortresses will soon face similar waves of monsters. We must arrive before it’s too late." "…I see." "We don’t have a choice. Prepare the troops for redeployment immediately." The Marquis hesitated but eventually nodded. They had come to fight off this monster wave, and this battle was only part of the larger campaign. Other fortresses still needed their aid. However, the troops were utterly spent. Marching immediately would place an enormous burden on them. _"Do we really have to face another wave of monsters like this?"_ the Marquis thought, a wave of dread washing over him. He was exhausted, and he could only imagine the terror among the soldiers. Ghislain, sensing his hesitation, smiled reassuringly. "This was the most dangerous and intense battle we’ll face. Other fortresses will face smaller waves, and they’ll have reinforcements from mages. There’s no need to worry too much." "Ha… Of course, Your Grace. I wasn’t worried at all," the Marquis replied, sweat beading on his brow. Knowing that the next battles would be easier provided some comfort. And with the combined strength of mages and superhumans, they could manage. "Then… would you address the troops yourself? I believe your words would do much to boost their morale." "Of course. That’s not a problem." Ghislain mounted his black steed and rode to the front of the gathered soldiers. Though his body ached, he showed no sign of discomfort. The Black King also seemed accustomed to such displays, raising its head imperiously as if it owned the battlefield. Ghislain’s voice rang out, steady and resolute. "We must head to the next fortress immediately! It will be tough, but do not worry. The monster waves there will not be as severe, and reinforcements of mages and superhumans will support us!" The soldiers’ faces darkened slightly. They were already pushed to their limits. Seeing this, Ghislain offered them a warm smile, his tone gentle yet firm. "Just a little more effort, and we’ll be done! The rear fortresses have plenty of supplies, weapons, and fresh troops. You’ll have ample time to rest once we arrive." Some soldiers managed weak smiles, buoyed by the prospect of easier battles ahead. Yet, exhaustion weighed heavily on them all. Ghislain, fully aware of their fatigue, decided to give them one final push. "I swear on my name: all who have fought valiantly here will receive a reward equivalent to three years’ wages after the campaign!" The soldiers’ eyes widened in astonishment. Whatever the financial situation, a reward like that was more than enough to reignite their spirits.
