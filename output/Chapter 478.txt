Kaspar, whose throat had been pierced, tried to gather his strength and recover somehow. However, the axe handle embedded in his neck made it impossible for him to heal properly. The Aura Blade constantly erupted from it, disrupting any attempt at regeneration. “Cough! You… how… g-gah…” Kaspar’s eyes widened in disbelief as he spat out blood foam. Just moments ago, the opponent had clearly been below his level. Their techniques had been troublesome, but they were nowhere near surpassing someone like him, who controlled even the flow of time itself. And yet, in such a short span of time, they had broken through the wall and ascended to the realm of superhuman strength! “G-grr… I… made you… awaken…” Realizing the situation, Kaspar’s face twisted into an expression of despair. His opponent had been a top-tier knight, someone who could break through the wall and ascend at any moment. Most never achieved such a state, so Kaspar hadn’t factored in the risk. But now, by his own hand, he had created another powerful enemy for the Salvation Order. With a cold expression, Gillian spoke. “Thanks to you, I’ve risked my life and surpassed the wall. As repayment, I’ll send you off peacefully.” _Paaaak!_ The Aura Blade surged violently, severing Kaspar’s throat completely. A judge and superhuman of the Salvation Order, Kaspar paid the ultimate price for his carelessness. “Cough!” As soon as Kaspar fell, Gillian also collapsed to his knees, coughing up blood. His body was covered in too many wounds to remain standing. When he raised his head, he saw more Delphine knights and soldiers advancing than before. They had used their numerical advantage to push through the Royal Army soldiers and climb the fortress walls. “Kill him first!” At the shout of a Delphine knight, several soldiers charged toward Gillian. Gritting his teeth, Gillian tried to stand, but his legs refused to cooperate. Fenris knights in the vicinity rushed to his aid, but the Delphine knights were quicker. Just as the Delphine soldiers were about to overwhelm Gillian, Ereneth moved. _Paaaang!_ “Argh!” Ereneth approached in an instant, summoning spirits to push back the Delphine knights. The Fenris knights used the opportunity to attack the fallen enemies, cutting them down before they could resist. Once the area was cleared, Ereneth turned to Gillian with a smile. “Congratulations. You’ve finally broken through the wall.” “…Thank you. Was this your plan all along?” “I thought it might happen. A knight of your caliber should’ve crossed the wall long ago.” “I nearly died in the process.” Gillian laughed bitterly, but Ereneth replied with a matter-of-fact expression. “If your resolve isn’t strong enough to risk your life, you’ll never reach the realm of the superhuman.” With those words, Ereneth turned away. Though she spoke confidently, the truth was that she had been holding back her full strength in the battle thus far to ensure Gillian survived. Now, with no need to worry about him, she could focus on the fight entirely. As she gazed beyond the fortress walls, she spoke softly. “The Count of Fenris has arrived. The more I see him, the more fascinating he becomes.” It had only been a few days since he had dealt with the 3rd Corps, yet he was already here. In the realm of war, he truly was a transcendent figure. With him, this time, they might finally eradicate the Salvation Order for good. “My choice was the right one.” Ereneth smiled as she gathered her energy. Joining the Northern Army had been a brilliant decision. She had no way of knowing about Claude’s covert operations behind the scenes. _Kwaaaang!_ Ereneth unleashed her energy, summoning numerous intermediate and lower-ranked spirits. The spirits spread out, assisting the allied soldiers across the battlefield. By using precise, contained energy rather than indiscriminately powerful attacks, she minimized collateral damage—an ideal strategy for chaotic skirmishes. As the judge of the Salvation Order fell by Gillian’s hand and the fortress wall was gradually secured, chaos erupted below. “It’s the Fenris Army! The Fenris cavalry is here!” At the panicked cries of his subordinates, Count Falgau clenched his teeth and turned his head. _Dududududu!_ Around 20,000 cavalry riders advanced under the Fenris banner. The man leading the charge was unfamiliar to him, but there was no doubt about his identity. “It’s the Count of Fenris!” His appearance was too distinctive, and the army following him clearly belonged to Fenris. It could only be him. How he had managed to arrive so quickly was a mystery, but there was no time to dwell on it. The cavalry charge would soon reach them. “At this rate, we’ll be attacked on the flank!” As his subordinates shouted in alarm, Count Falgau scanned the surroundings. The advancing Fenris army was throwing everyone into a frenzy. With their forces climbing the fortress walls, only to face an enemy charge from the side, the confusion was inevitable. Count Falgau roared, “Fall back! Everyone, fall back! Stop the cavalry charge first!” _Boom! Boom! Boom!_ _Bwooo!_ Drums and horns sounded from all directions. The soldiers scrambled to retreat and regroup their formations. At least, that was the plan. “Don’t stop! Keep firing!” Gillian shouted from atop the fortress, and the Fenris archers let loose their arrows without hesitation. _Paaak!_ Arrows darkened the sky, raining down on the retreating Delphine forces. “Argh!” “Hold your ground! Hold it!” “Retreat slowly!” The knights and commanders bellowed orders, trying to rally their soldiers. But with the enemy closing in, panic spread. The relentless arrows from the fortress further disrupted their formations. _Dududududu!_ Meanwhile, the Fenris cavalry advanced at incredible speed. The collision was imminent. Unable to bear it any longer, Count Falgau shouted again. “Mages! Attack them now!” “We can’t! We’re holding back the spirits! If we release our power, we’ll be exposed to the arrows!” If they used their magic now, the high-ranked spirits restrained below the fortress would wreak havoc. In their already disorganized state, such an attack would obliterate them completely. Ereneth continued to focus her energy on the high-ranked spirits. Her intent was clear: keep the enemy’s magical forces tied up. It was precisely why Claude had sent her to this battlefield. She could counter both magical and conventional forces simultaneously. No matter which option the Delphine army chose, they would collapse. “Damn it!” Count Falgau was at a loss. Even their superhuman had fallen. Their formation was shattered, and the Fenris cavalry was bearing down on them. “This battle is over.” The 4th Corps would be annihilated here. Count Falgau had only one choice left. “Attack the Count of Fenris! Do it now!” The soldiers were abandoned. If they were doomed to lose anyway, they needed to reduce the number of Fenris cavalry and weaken the Count himself. The mages, understanding Count Falgau’s intent, redirected all their remaining power. Simultaneously, the high-ranked spirits summoned by Ereneth began to move. _Kwaaaang!_ _Kwaang!_ “Argh!” A massive fire lizard summoned beneath the fortress breathed flames, incinerating the retreating soldiers instantly. An earth spirit emerged deeper into their ranks, collapsing the ground and sending soldiers tumbling. The fallen soldiers were defenseless against the rain of arrows. “Kill them all!” Count Falgau screamed himself hoarse, demanding sacrifices to slow the Fenris cavalry. _Paaang!_ The mages’ spells shot toward the advancing cavalry, and the ground beneath them quaked with gathered energy. At that moment, Parniel leapt from her horse. _Thud!_ Parniel drove her mace into the ground, releasing a radiant light that spread in all directions. The light created a powerful divine barrier, neutralizing the magic surging from the ground. _Boom! Boom!_ The spells collided with the barrier, erupting harmlessly. Though the ground shook and cracks spread, the Fenris cavalry maintained their formation with their exceptional riding skills. The remaining spells fired by the mages were similarly blocked by the divine barrier and dissipated. Seeing their efforts thwarted, the Delphine mages faltered, their faces twisting in despair. Having already expended most of their energy, they had nothing left to offer. Their only thought now was how to escape. And so, as the Delphine army fell into complete disarray, Ghislain charged into their ranks. _Kwaaaang!_ “Argh!” The already broken Delphine forces crumbled further as Ghislain and the Fenris cavalry tore through them. “Crush them all!” Ghislain and the Fenris cavalry pressed forward relentlessly, carving through the enemy ranks with such force that the Delphine formation seemed to cave in entirely. Meanwhile, Parniel’s rampage was unparalleled. _Boom! Boom! Boom!_ Swinging her massive mace, Parniel crushed dozens of soldiers with each strike, a whirlwind of destruction that solidified her reputation as a battlefield butcher. “Run for your lives!” The sight of Parniel’s devastating assault drained the last vestiges of morale from the Delphine soldiers. Even as the Fenris cavalry’s charge began to lose momentum, Parniel only grew fiercer. Watching Parniel decimate the enemy, Ghislain mused aloud, “Should I give Elena a new weapon? A blunt weapon might suit her divine power better.” The enormous axe they had provided had been their only option at the time. Perhaps it was time to commission Galbaric for something new. “Let’s not fall behind the Saintess! Push harder!” “Waaaah!” The Fenris cavalry roared, their confidence surging as they massacred the enemy. On the fortress walls, cheers erupted as well. What had seemed like an unwinnable battle had turned decisively in their favor. The Fenris archers, emboldened, unleashed their arrows at an incredible pace, nearly exhausting their supply. The battlefield echoed with the cries of the Delphine forces. The cavalry charge had left them exposed, spirits ran rampant, and retreating soldiers were mercilessly cut down by arrows. Chaos consumed the Delphine army, now more a scattered rabble than an organized force. Count Falgau surveyed the scene with a vacant expression. ‘What the hell is this?’ They had been winning. Even with their supply lines disrupted, they had been confident in their strategy. Even after losing their judge, they should have secured victory. But Ghislain Ferdium had arrived. “Run! Everyone, run!” The mages were the first to flee, pouring what little magic they had left into escaping. Their panic infected the soldiers, who scattered like ants. “Come back… Stop them…” Count Falgau muttered, his mind adrift. One man. Just one man had turned the tide so completely. What had the other corps been doing that they couldn’t hold this person back? “You must flee!” His bodyguard’s urgent shout broke through his haze. Count Falgau bit his lip and drew his sword. Flee? Where could he run? The Count of Fenris would never let him go. At that moment, a shadow appeared above him. “Here I am!” Dark, the spectral raven, cawed from overhead. Count Falgau stared blankly at the speaking bird. But the moment of confusion was short-lived. _Kwaaaang!_ “Argh!” A man burst through the front line of soldiers, cutting them down as he advanced. His body radiated a dark, shimmering aura, his crimson eyes glowing with a predatory glint. The savage grin on his face sent shivers down Count Falgau’s spine. The man straightened on his horse, drawing back his spear. Count Falgau could only stare, frozen, as the spear flew toward him. _Thwack!_ The spear pierced his chest with devastating force.
