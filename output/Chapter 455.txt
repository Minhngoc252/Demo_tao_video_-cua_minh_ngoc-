Bellinda’s frustration was palpable as she glared at the indifferent faces around her. “What’s with those reactions? I just revealed my secretive, mysterious past, and that’s all I get? Why isn’t anyone surprised?” “…” The others exchanged glances, unsure of how to respond, until Kaor broke the silence with a blunt outburst. “Who doesn’t know you’re an assassin?! You lead the manor’s assassination unit! If you’re going to spill secrets, at least tell us how you know that weird guy who sent the letter!” “I _was_ about to, but your reactions ruined my moment!” “…” Bellinda took a deep breath to compose herself before continuing. “Fine. I was part of an assassination group, and that guy who sent the letter? We fought against him. The thing is…” She hesitated, letting out a sigh before finishing. “…That guy was definitely killed by our leader. I don’t understand how he’s still alive.” Ghislain frowned in confusion. “Your leader? Killed him? Couldn’t this just be an impersonator?” Bellinda, now calmer, nodded slightly before countering. “Maybe. But what would be the point of impersonating someone nobody knows? None of you recognized the name or the symbol, so why go to the trouble?” “Fair point.” Ghislain agreed. It didn’t make sense to impersonate someone obscure. The name “Melkir” and the crescent moon symbol didn’t ring any bells for anyone but Bellinda. “But are you certain he’s supposed to be dead?” “Absolutely. Our leader destroyed his mana core after finishing him off. I don’t understand this either.” Ghislain pressed further, his curiosity piqued. “Then where’s this ‘leader’ now?” Bellinda paused, avoiding Ghislain’s gaze as she mumbled, “They passed away a long time ago.” The group exchanged skeptical glances. Her evasiveness made her story seem even more suspicious. Ghislain’s mind buzzed with a sudden theory, but before he could voice it, Bellinda snapped irritably. “That’s not the point right now! The issue is that this guy—whether he’s the real one or not—is using the same methods. He wouldn’t do this without reason!” “Hmm…” After a moment of thought, Ghislain nodded. It didn’t seem like a decoy strategy. The Duke’s faction had a vested interest in making this assassination succeed. “So, either he survived, or someone’s imitating his techniques?” “Exactly! And I need to see him with my own eyes. If you’re not going to Ferdium, I’ll go alone!” Bellinda’s eyes burned with unbridled hatred. This wasn’t just a mission to her—it was personal. Ghislain observed her carefully, realizing that Melkir had left her with a deep grudge. **‘I suppose we’ll find out soon enough.’** “What was his skill level, anyway?” Ghislain asked. Bellinda’s face hardened. “He was already a master assassin twenty years ago.” The room fell silent, tension thickening in the air. A master assassin from twenty years ago could have refined their skills to an unimaginable level. But Ghislain remained unfazed. “Just because he was a master doesn’t mean he got any stronger. Mastery isn’t a guarantee of growth—sometimes people stagnate after reaching their peak.” Ereneth, the elven chieftain, nodded slightly in agreement, but the others still looked uneasy. “Besides,” Ghislain continued, “if he’s the real deal, he was supposedly near death when you last saw him. He might’ve spent the past two decades recovering. If he’s a fake, he’s likely a recent master with less experience.” Bellinda jumped at the chance to bolster her argument. “Exactly! That’s why we need to confirm whether he’s the real one or not.” “Fair enough. By the way, what’s with this symbol?” “It’s the mark of the Black Moon,” Bellinda explained. “It’s their insignia.” “Does it have a specific meaning?” “When the target is alive, it’s a crescent moon. If the assassination succeeds, it changes to a full moon.” “Quite the poetic bunch,” Ghislain remarked with a wry smile as he stood. The Duke’s faction was pulling every trick in the book to separate him from the northern army. It was clear they believed his absence would turn the tide. Sometimes, the best way to counter an enemy’s schemes was to play along—and then strike back hard. Ghislain issued his orders. “For now, Claude will take over commanding the northern army.” Ereneth seemed surprised, but no one protested. Despite his grumbling, Claude had already proven his competence. Claude scowled and kicked at the ground, visibly displeased with his new responsibilities. “Bellinda, Gillian, pick a few knights. We’ll move as a small unit.” This time, there was some dissent. Vanessa was the first to protest. “Lord Ghislain! Let me come with you!” “No. The Duke’s forces are bound to target the northern army while I’m away. You need to stay and hold them off, especially since they’ll likely launch a full assault.” “But Ereneth is here!” “We still need you, Vanessa. Without you, our forces will take unnecessary losses.” Reluctantly, Vanessa stepped back. Defending the northern army was just as crucial. “I’ll go!” Alfoy piped up, puffing out his chest. “The man who defied a god will lend his strength!” Unsurprisingly, his offer was ignored. Everyone knew he just wanted to avoid the battlefield. Ghislain turned to Ereneth, ready to depart. “I’m counting on you to manage things here. The enemy doesn’t know about you or Tenant yet, so they’ll be caught off guard. This will be their last attempt at pulling a stunt like this.” Ereneth nodded, though her expression was tinged with concern. “Are you sure about Claude?” “What about him?” “He’s capable, but his demeanor doesn’t inspire confidence. This is an important battle.” Ghislain chuckled. “Personality doesn’t determine competence. Just follow his lead during combat, and things will be fine.” “…If you say so. But how do you plan to track the assassins?” “Good question. I’ll wait in Ferdium and figure it out when they make their move.” Ereneth clicked her tongue in mild disapproval before offering, “I’ll help. We’re ‘family,’ after all. It’s the least I can do.” “Oh? How?” “I can use my spirits to scout the area. There are limits to their range, but I can sweep Ferdium for their presence.” “Impressive. I’ll leave it to you, then.” Ghislain had known about Ereneth’s abilities in his past life but played dumb. Her spirit magic had been invaluable for scouting critical areas during the war. Though her abilities had limitations—such as susceptibility to magical interference or weak spirit energy in certain areas—they were still immensely useful. “I’ll leave one of Dark’s fragments here. Since I’m linked to him, you can pass messages to me through him. I’ll also send a fragment to Ferdium for coordination.” “…Very well.” Ereneth still seemed to harbor some doubts about Dark’s existence. It was too similar to abilities she was already familiar with. However, since she wasn’t voicing her suspicions, all Ghislain could do was keep an eye on her for now. “Let’s move out. We’ll make sure they never pull a stunt like this again.” With a small group of trusted aides and knights, Ghislain set off toward Ferdium. Before departing, he sent Dark ahead—not just to receive Ereneth’s reconnaissance updates, but also to ensure that Ferdium’s defenses were at their absolute peak before his arrival. As soon as Ghislain departed, Ereneth settled in an open clearing, where the natural energy was most abundant. “Guard me.” The elves who accompanied her moved into position, emanating a sharp, vigilant aura. Claude, once again finding himself in an unexpected leadership role, stationed knights and soldiers around her as well. **“If the lord isn’t here, the Grand Chieftain’s the strongest in the northern army, right? If I want to survive, I’d better stay on her good side,”** he mused, smirking as he hovered around Ereneth like an obedient lackey. Ereneth, unaware of his true intentions, wore an expression of mild irritation at his presence. Suddenly, thick vines sprouted from the ground and coiled around Ereneth’s body as she closed her eyes and tilted her head toward the northern sky. A low, resonant hum filled the air around her. The atmosphere began to shift. Winds swirled from all directions, rustling the wild grasses scattered across the earth. Birds flocked overhead, their cries echoing loudly as they circled above. Dark clouds gathered over her, blotting out the sun. The space around Ereneth shimmered and distorted as if invisible forces were converging upon her. “What… what is this?” “Is this really the Grand Chieftain’s power?” “It’s like watching a miracle performed by the Saintess!” The sheer intensity of her power sent shockwaves through the onlookers. Knights and soldiers instinctively stepped back, unable to process the overwhelming presence. Elves from the Fenris faction, drawn by the immense natural energy, slowly approached her in awe. For Lumina, the experience was especially humbling. As the first elf to successfully communicate with nature under Ghislain’s guidance, she had prided herself on her achievements. But now she understood how small her accomplishments were in comparison. “Ah…” It felt as though all of existence was whispering to Ereneth. The wild grasses no one had noticed, the winds that merely stirred dust, the earth they stood upon, and even the tiniest insects scurrying nearby—all were speaking to her. They shared what they saw and felt, weaving a network of information from faraway places to her mind. This was true communication with nature. This was a power only Ereneth, blessed by the World Tree, could wield. But such a miraculous ability came at a cost. “Cough!” A spray of blood erupted from Ereneth’s lips as the energy surrounding her dissipated in an instant. “Grand Chieftain!” “Are you alright?” “Quick, someone assist her!” Alarmed, the elves rushed to her side, but Ereneth waved them off. “I’m fine. As I suspected, using this power away from the World Tree isn’t easy.” Near the World Tree, the burden of this ability was shared, but here, she bore it alone. After taking a steadying breath, she spoke again. “I’ll rest for a bit and try again. Ferdium’s lord’s castle is safe for now.” Her words left everyone stunned. She had briefly glimpsed Ferdium from this distant location—a feat even an 8th-circle mage couldn’t achieve. It seemed unbelievable, but Ereneth’s reputation as a legendary Grand Chieftain silenced any doubts. Claude, however, had other thoughts. **“Damn, she’s amazing. Sure, this’ll be handy in the war, but… if she can spy on Ferdium, I bet I could run some secret trades under the radar. Better stay on her good side and persuade her later.”** Oblivious to Claude’s schemes, Ereneth prepared for another attempt. This wasn’t something that could be achieved in a single session. The assassins might not have even arrived yet, so she had to scan the area repeatedly. “Cough!” Each time, blood stained the ground. The elves following her could no longer stand by idly. “Please, Grand Chieftain, stop this!” “Without the World Tree, this is too much for you!” “You can’t possibly scour the entire area like this!” Despite their protests, Ereneth shook her head. “No. I only need to monitor the area near the lord’s castle. That’s where they’ll go. This much, I can still handle. I promised to help, and I will.” Her unwavering resolve left the elves no room to argue. A Grand Chieftain’s promise was as unyielding as stone. Meanwhile, Claude silently mused again. **“What a noble elf. If only everyone in the world were like her, things would be better. Too bad they’re not. Guess that’s why we need nature to keep us honest.”** His thoughts were shameless, even as he believed them to be earnest. Nearby, Wendy shot him a glare. By now, she could tell exactly what he was thinking just by looking at his face. After days of scanning the area around the lord’s castle, Ereneth finally found something. “I’ve found them,” she announced.
