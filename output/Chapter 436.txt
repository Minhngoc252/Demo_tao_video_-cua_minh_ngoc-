As Ghislain leapt into the fray, the soldiers were struck with shock and disbelief. They knew all too well what this meant: he intended to hold back the enemy alone to buy them time. It wasn’t the first time he’d done something like this, but even in the past, he had brought mercenaries or knights with him. This level of recklessness, fighting such overwhelming numbers alone, was rare. **“Ghislain!”** Zwalter’s voice thundered across the battlefield. This wasn’t the first time his son had done something so infuriating. During the siege of Ferdium, Ghislain had similarly plunged into enemy lines, causing his father endless anxiety. **“My lord!”** **“Young Master!”** Belinda and Gillian called out desperately. They understood his intentions, but the sheer number of enemies this time was on a completely different scale. Already, Ghislain was swallowed by a gray tide of Rift creatures, his figure barely visible amidst the chaos. As his allies moved to descend and support him, Ghislain’s commanding voice echoed from below: **“Do not come down! Rest, eat, and reorganize the formation! I won’t push myself unnecessarily!”** Hearing this, his aides and knights hesitated, unable to disobey his orders. They understood the reality of the situation. The Rift had expanded far beyond anything they’d encountered before, its territory teeming with countless creatures. Maintaining combat effectiveness against such overwhelming odds was no simple task. Ghislain was buying them precious time to rest and regroup. Vanessa stepped forward. **“I’ll create a wall to support him.”** Although conserving mana was crucial, holding back too much could also lead to disaster. If their forces crumbled before even reaching Equidema, no amount of mana would save them. Reluctantly, the others nodded, knowing that they had no choice but to make the most of the time Ghislain was buying. **Screech!** Ghislain drew the attention of the largest mass of Rift creatures, luring them toward him. His body radiated divine energy, and the creatures, maddened by its presence, charged at him with reckless abandon. Thanks to his efforts, the number of creatures scaling the fortress walls dropped to less than half. **“Earth Wall!”** **Boom!** Vanessa raised walls around the perimeter again, further reducing the flow of enemies. The knights held the line on the walls, taking turns to rest, while the soldiers seized their first opportunity to drink water and consume rations. As they rested, they watched Ghislain fight. His movements were nothing short of awe-inspiring. **Boom!** Ghislain only unleashed bursts of mana when the creatures became too densely packed, creating space around him. This wasn’t his usual combat style, where he would obliterate enemies with overwhelming force. Instead, he fought with precision and restraint. **Screech!** **Slash!** Ghislain’s spear arced in a wide circle, decapitating dozens of Rift creatures in a single sweep. He conserved his mana, relying on pure skill to cut through the horde. **Thrust! Thrust! Thrust!** In a single breath, his spear struck dozens of times, piercing the heads of every creature surrounding him. Even as more creatures surged into the void left behind, Vanessa’s magic provided support. **Boom!** Explosions erupted around him, giving him moments to reposition and continue drawing the creatures away. **“How can he fight like that?”** **“It’s not brute strength.”** **“It’s like… he’s dancing.”** Until now, Ghislain’s sheer destructive power had overshadowed his technique, making it difficult to fully grasp his skill. But now, with his restrained approach, every movement of his spear was a masterclass in efficiency. **Clang! Clang! Clang!** Ghislain parried and dodged the attacks of the creatures surrounding him, countering with deadly precision. His movements flowed like water, fluid and unyielding. Despite killing fewer enemies per strike compared to his usual methods, his performance demonstrated how to fight with the utmost efficiency. It was as if he were showing everyone the pinnacle of combat skill. “**Incredible.** ” Even Kaor, who rarely praised anyone, was momentarily lost in admiration. Ghislain wasn’t just surviving—he was growing stronger with each battle. It was almost unbelievable. **Boom!** Vanessa’s magic erupted again, scattering the Rift creatures surging toward Ghislain. Within the chaos, his crimson-black spear moved like a striking serpent, cutting down all in its path. Watching him, the knights and soldiers swallowed hard. **“He truly is the strongest in the North…”** Ghislain’s presence was electrifying. Simply witnessing his battle filled them with adrenaline and resolve. Fighting alongside him, they felt as though defeat was impossible. It was this unshakable confidence that kept the morale of the Fenris forces so high. **“Let’s push a little harder!”** **“We’ve fought Rifts before—this is nothing new!”** **“How long will we let the Duke fight alone?”** The soldiers, reinvigorated, rose to their feet. After consuming their rations and water, they felt a renewed sense of strength and purpose. **“Hurrah!”** Their rallying cries echoed as they surged forward, striking down the creatures scaling the walls. Even the elves, now out of arrows, joined the melee, supporting their comrades with their unmatched agility and precision. With Ghislain drawing attention away, the defenders atop the fortress walls regained control, solidifying their formation and repelling the creatures. The battle returned to its initial state, with the defenders regaining their footing. **“Vanessa!”** At Ghislain’s command, Vanessa unleashed her magic once more. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** Pillars of fire erupted around him, incinerating the surrounding creatures. Taking advantage of the momentary reprieve, Ghislain climbed back onto the wall. Steam rose from his body, the result of the intense heat. “**Young Master!** ” Belinda rushed to him, draping a cool, damp cloth over his shoulders. “**Where did this come from?** ” Ghislain asked, bemused. “**I prepared it in advance.** ” “**As expected of Belinda. Thanks.** ” Wiping his face, Ghislain grinned and shouted, **“Let’s get back to it! Just a bit more!”** The battle stretched on. Ten thousand Rift creatures had taken an entire day to defeat in the past, but this time, the horde was even larger, and their own forces smaller. However, the defenders held their ground with renewed determination. Vanessa’s magic continued to divide the creatures, while the mages targeted critical areas. The priests, under Ghislain’s direction, healed the soldiers at just the right moments. When the pressure became too great, Ghislain descended once again to divert the creatures’ focus. **“This is it,”** Ghislain thought, his sharp gaze scanning the battlefield. **“If we maintain this pace, we’ll win.”** Strong allies like Belinda, Gillian, and Kaor were invaluable, each commanding their own sections of the battlefield. Even Zwalter, Randolph, Skovan, and Ricardo held their own, inspiring the troops. The knights of Ferdium, their skills honed from recent training, fought as if this was their final battle. They were committed to defending their home, no matter the cost. **“Huff… huff…”** Skovan, swinging his sword with weary eyes, muttered to himself, **“Why is my life like this?”** He felt like he was living an endlessly grueling existence. At some point, he had stopped thinking about why he was fighting. His sword moved simply because there were enemies in front of him. Despite conserving his strength, his sword now emitted only a faint glow, his mana nearly depleted. **“Wait…”** A soldier muttered, his sluggish movements halting. **“There are fewer of them.”** Everyone paused, their exhaustion momentarily forgotten. The number of Rift creatures had drastically decreased. Only a few hundred climbed the walls now, a stark contrast to the earlier relentless waves. **“We’ve almost won…”** The realization spread like wildfire. The endless stream of creatures had finally thinned. Ghislain stood atop the wall, his breathing steady as he surveyed the battlefield. Most of the creatures that had climbed the walls were dead. The ones still advancing were scattered and sparse. The end was near. Only the final push remained. **“Everyone, fall back.”** At his command, the soldiers slowly withdrew, continuing to fight as they retreated. At the front, only Ghislain, his closest aides, Zwalter, and Randolph remained. **“Roarrr!”** In the distance, a feral growl echoed. The final battle was about to begin. Equidema’s purpose is clear: to expand the Rift's territory and protect it. It rarely moves from the Rift unless absolutely necessary, as it prioritizes conserving energy. However, there are rare occasions when the beast itself begins to stir. **Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud.** The ground trembled as something massive approached from the distance. Equidema was on the move. **“Hah…”** Ghislain drank water and steadied his breath. Rift creatures still climbed the walls sporadically, but most of the soldiers had collapsed from exhaustion. Even the knights, blood trickling from their lips, could barely remain standing. **Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud.** A guttural roar shook the air. **"ROOOAAARRR!"** Equidema’s movements had one clear purpose: to protect its domain. In previous battles, even when Ghislain and the Northern Army annihilated all the Rift creatures, Equidema had never intervened. It had always prioritized expansion, confident that the lost creatures could be replenished swiftly. But this time, things were different. The territory had grown vast, and an overwhelming number of Rift creatures had poured into this world—most of which were now dead. For the first time, Equidema perceived a threat significant enough to halt its expansion and rise from its position. **"ROOOAAARRR!"** The ground quaked as the beast closed in. Soldiers gripped their weapons tightly, nerves fraying with every tremor. Compounding the tension, the sporadic trickle of Rift creatures began to grow again. Though not as overwhelming as before, their numbers steadily climbed back into the thousands. It was grotesque how quickly they replenished, though they still lacked any semblance of strategy. **"Ugh…"** Despite their exhaustion, the soldiers forced themselves to stand, gripping their weapons with trembling hands. **"Screeeech!"** Rift creatures once again climbed the walls, clawing their way toward the defenders. Ghislain, however, did not engage them this time. His allies took over the task of holding the line, while Ghislain directed his focus forward. He swung his sword with deliberate force. **BOOOM!** A thunderous explosion echoed as a massive figure landed atop the wall. **Grrrrr…** Equidema had arrived. Thin scars marked its face, though none were severe. The soldiers froze, their faces paling as primal fear gripped their hearts. Instinctively, some stepped back. **"ROOOAAARRR!"** The beast’s furious roar paralyzed the weary soldiers, causing many to drop their weapons. As Ghislain locked eyes with Equidema, an intense standoff ensued. In that brief moment, the Rift creatures surged again, swarming the immobilized soldiers. Ghislain and his closest allies were preoccupied with the colossal beast, unable to fend off the smaller creatures. But help arrived. From behind, a radiant, celestial voice rang out, like a divine decree descending from the heavens: **[Thus says the Goddess: I grant you the power to trample them and subdue every enemy. None shall harm you.]** **CLANG!** A brilliant light erupted across the battlefield, enveloping everyone in its glow.
