Ghislain took a step back and spoke calmly. “This isn’t the right place for this. Let’s take it outside.” From the moment Parniel started emanating her aura, Ghislain instinctively knew a fight was inevitable. That’s why he had already drawn his sword. In her past life, she had always acted on her instincts. Yet, the outcomes had rarely been unfavorable. After all, her unwavering belief in justice—delivering judgment upon evil—drove her actions. Following Ghislain’s suggestion, the two moved outside, and the tension became palpable. The Fenris Rapid Deployment Corps, waiting nearby, gripped their reins tightly as if ready to charge at any moment. Meanwhile, the priests and temple knights accompanying Parniel watched with wary expressions. “Let’s get this started.” **Whoosh!** As Ghislain drew upon his mana, the dark energy surrounding him intensified, becoming even more ominous. Parniel narrowed her eyes at the sight. “A most suspicious aura.” “It just turned out this way.” Though Ghislain appreciated the amplification of his power thanks to Dark, this situation was undoubtedly exhausting. Fortunately, only individuals like Ereneth and Parniel reacted so strongly to his energy. Both were particularly sensitive to such forces. However, Parniel was unlike Ereneth. Through battle, she would realize that Ghislain’s power was distinct from that of the Salvation Order. That’s the nature of divine energy, after all. **Thud!** Parniel approached, hefting her mace. “You’ll need to give this your all.” **Bam!** Suddenly, her mace came crashing down toward Ghislain’s head with the force of a landslide. A single hit from such an attack would kill most people outright. Yet, Parniel’s expression showed she was utterly unbothered by the prospect. **Boom!** Ghislain raised his sword to block the strike. However, directly absorbing the full force of the attack would have been reckless. **Clang!** Pivoting his body alongside his blade, Ghislain redirected the force of the mace. His movements were fluid, like water, as his sword naturally extended forward. **Slash!** A thin wound appeared on Parniel’s cheek, and blood spurted out. Ghislain’s gaze was cold and emotionless, almost chilling. His expression conveyed that he wouldn’t hesitate to kill his opponent if necessary. Without such resolve, even landing a scratch on her would have been impossible. **Whoosh!** Parniel didn’t hesitate for a moment. The instant the blade grazed her cheek, she swung her mace again. If it connected, it would undoubtedly shatter Ghislain’s side. **Crash!** Ghislain blocked the attack with his sword and stepped back. As expected of someone blessed with divine power, Parniel’s strength was overwhelming. Ghislain had to diffuse the force of each clash carefully. Parniel smirked faintly. “Your movements are like a ghost’s.” Her blows weren’t landing as they should. She had to admit that her opponent’s techniques surpassed her own. If that’s the case, overwhelming power and speed would suffice. **Crack.** Her muscles swelled as veins bulged across her body. A faint glow enveloped her frame. In a flash, Parniel closed the distance and swung her mace with incredible speed. **Boom!** Her mace struck the ground with devastating force. Observers couldn’t breathe a sigh of relief, even though Ghislain dodged it. The impact left a massive crater in the ground, as if a meteor had struck. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** The earth groaned in protest with each of Parniel’s relentless strikes. Her mace created massive pits, one after another, as though she were smashing bugs beneath her feet. Even though Ghislain evaded every attack, he couldn’t recklessly move closer. ‘Damn, her raw strength is absurd. Elena should strive to reach this level someday.’ Parniel’s combat style was universally acknowledged as the most brutal among the Continent’s Seven Strongest. That much was clear. Having no choice, Ghislain drew upon more power. **Whoosh!** A dark aura surged around him, crackling like a living flame. Activating all three of his cores, Ghislain moved as swiftly as light. **Boom!** Just as Parniel’s mace struck the ground again, Ghislain slashed at her arm like a bolt of lightning. **Clang!** The strike carried enough power to sever her arm, yet it only left a shallow, thin line, accompanied by a metallic screech. ‘As expected.’ Clicking his tongue, Ghislain retreated. The most fearsome aspect of a saintess was her nearly impenetrable defense. Unless his attacks carried immense energy, they couldn’t pierce a body fortified with divine power. This resilience allowed her to unleash devastating attacks without hesitation. ‘Hah, I have no idea how long this will take.’ Her endurance was another terrifying aspect. A saintess could draw upon divine power to maintain an unyielding stamina, allowing them to fight tirelessly for days on end. It was that very ability that enabled her to face down the “Master of the Dead” and their legions of corpses. Though Parniel often referred to the Salvation Order’s priests as cockroaches, many thought the term fit her better. They simply didn’t dare say it to her face. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** Parniel continued swinging her mace with extraordinary force and speed. Yet none of her strikes landed cleanly. ‘Incredible. To think someone could wield such technique….’ As a battle priestess, Parniel had honed her skills since childhood. She had never slacked in her training, her days filled with prayer and devotion. Eventually, her mastery of technique surpassed that of any knight. Combined with her divine strength, towering physique, and unparalleled skill, she believed herself to be born for battle—a blessing bestowed by the goddess herself. ‘Yet this man surpasses me.’ As another saintess who walked the path of battle, she understood the effort it took to reach such heights. She couldn’t help but feel a sense of awe. And something else entirely. ‘Could battle be this… exhilarating?’ Having lived her entire life within the confines of the church, she had never met a true equal. Everyone knelt before her in reverence or fear. Even the priests of the Salvation Order were weak by comparison. While their powers were potent, their techniques were inferior. Parniel had no friends. Her days consisted of reading scriptures, praying, and training. She had always been a lonely, isolated existence. But now... ‘I had no idea fighting could be this fun!’ For the first time in her life, Parniel found joy in combat. She wanted this exchange to last a little longer. **Crack!** Parniel grinned, clenching her teeth tightly. **Boom!** Every swing of her mace tore apart the ground, sending shockwaves through the battlefield. Her attacks began distorting the air itself. Ghislain saw her transformation and smirked. ‘Looks like she’s finally enjoying herself.’ It was the same in her past life. The more Parniel fought, the more she reveled in the thrill of combat, especially against formidable opponents like the Continent’s Seven Strongest. This was the true nature of the saintess who served the goddess of war. ‘Maybe I should join in a bit more.’ **Whoosh!** Ghislain’s body became completely enveloped in a dark aura. After all, he enjoyed the heat of battle too. If he hated fighting, he would never have risen to the throne of the Mercenary King. Finally, Ghislain’s sword clashed directly with Parniel’s mace. **Boom!** The collision of Ghislain’s mana and Parniel’s divine energy unleashed a powerful shockwave. Observers instinctively shielded their eyes as blinding light erupted. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** Their battle grew even more ferocious, forcing onlookers to step further back. Parniel, exhilarated, shouted with a gleeful expression. “Count Fenris! You’re truly incredible!” “I know.” **Boom!** The two warriors unleashed their full strength and skill. Lacking the ability to sustain his power for long, Ghislain compensated with superior technique, guiding the fight. As the battle raged on, Maurice, watching from afar, felt the color drain from his face. He had been in a great mood ever since the saintess joined their cause. Hearing that Ghislain had obliterated the Delphine forces on his way here only added to his excitement. ‘But why the hell are they fighting each other?!’ It was one thing for Ghislain, known for his reckless nature, but who would have thought the reliable saintess was just as wild? Looking like a dog about to relieve itself, Maurice turned to a priest leading the saintess’s clergy. “Hey, can’t you stop her? Someone’s going to die at this rate!” The priest closed his eyes and shook his head. “What the saintess does is the will of the goddess.” It was no exaggeration to call her the goddess’s representative. Once she set her mind on something, no one could stop her. And frankly, even if they tried, she wouldn’t listen. Maurice’s frustration boiled over. “What kind of goddess’s will is this?! Why is she fighting so fiercely when he’s not even the enemy? Just stop her!” “It’s all according to the goddess’s will.” “Damn it! Then our old fortune-telling hag’s words must be the goddess’s will too!” “Lord Marquis! That’s a dangerous statement! You could face an inquisition—” Maurice waved dismissively. “I don’t care! This isn’t the Church! This is Ruthania! I’m the commander-in-chief of this kingdom’s army! Don’t you know even the priests here bow their heads to me?!” “Even so, how dare you compare a fortune-teller to the goddess!” “I don’t care! Just stop her! What, is her brain made of muscle too?!” “Lord Marquis, please! That’s too much!” “What’s too much?! You’re the ones who are too much!” Instead of de-escalating the situation, Maurice and the priest devolved into a shouting match. Commanders and soldiers nearby exchanged uneasy glances. One side was the saintess, and the other was the northern army’s commander. Watching them fight would only bring disaster. The growing tension spread like wildfire, unsettling everyone within the fortress. The Fenris knights shifted uneasily, their hands twitching as if ready to intervene. Even their warhorses snorted nervously, their hooves scraping the ground. Maurice grabbed the priest by the collar, his frustration erupting into a shout. “Damn it! Is this what you call coming to help? Everyone’s going to die at this rate! Can’t you see them over there? That’s the kingdom’s strongest army!” Hearing Maurice’s outburst, the priest hesitantly glanced over at the Fenris Rapid Deployment Corps. Their fierce presence made it seem as though they could charge at any moment. If that mass of soldiers attacked, they’d all be dead. No one wants to claim that their own death is part of the goddess’s will. That’s just human nature. “A-alright. We’ll try to stop her.” There was a way to stop Parniel, but it wasn’t something they could use lightly. The priests and temple knights who had accompanied her wore solemn expressions. They had to act before the saintess lost herself further. “Sainteeesssss! Please stop nowwwww!” They rushed forward and prostrated themselves around Parniel. Parniel, who had been swinging her mace at Ghislain, halted her attack. If she swung with all her might now, the priests around her would be reduced to dust. The ground surrounding her was already completely obliterated. As she ceased her assault, Ghislain stepped back with a smirk. “I think this is a good place to stop.” “I’m just starting to warm up.” “If we keep going, one of us is going to die.” “If that’s the goddess’s will, so be it.” “Enough. By now, you should know I have nothing to do with the Salvation Order.” “……” Parniel’s lips twitched. He was right. Ghislain’s energy might resemble the aura of the Salvation Order, but it was different. As someone who had fought against the Salvation Order’s priests countless times, she could tell. The opposing nature of their powers made it clear that Ghislain’s strength was something else entirely. But she had been enjoying the fight so much that she pushed on regardless. Ghislain calmed his energy and continued. “If either of us dies, the Salvation Order will rejoice. Is that the goddess’s will?” “……” “The atmosphere here is bad enough. Let’s stop now. But if you insist, I’ll have no choice but to finish this.” Ghislain fixed Parniel with a cold stare. While he needed her strength, if she remained stubborn, he would have no choice but to end the battle as quickly and decisively as possible. “Hah…” Parniel hesitated for a moment, then sighed, glancing around. Everyone was watching them with uneasy expressions. If she kept this up, a true disaster would unfold. Not to mention, the priests who had come to stop her would surely be the first to die. That would indeed delight the Salvation Order. She couldn’t allow it. “Fine. We’ll stop here for now.” “Don’t worry; there will be plenty of opportunities to fight. There are lots of strong foes out there.” “The goddess will surely guide us. I look forward to it.” Parniel nodded, pushing down her disappointment. Many nobles had allied with the Salvation Order, and there would be excellent knights and superhumans among them. Not to mention the Salvation Order’s high-ranking priests. There would be endless battles ahead. Though she doubted they’d be as exhilarating as this one. With the fight finally coming to an end, the tense atmosphere began to ease. The priests, still lying on the ground, looked as if they had narrowly escaped death. Maurice approached, visibly relieved. “Phew, let’s avoid fighting amongst allies, shall we? My heart can’t take it. Let’s head inside. Hey! Bring the prisoners along! Ghislain, we’ll discuss the prisoners during the strategy meeting.” Finally, the Northern Army, which had been on standby, could enter the fortress. With the uproar settling and the situation under control, Maurice finally let out a sigh of relief. This was the perfect time to change the subject. Maurice gathered Ghislain, Parniel, and the remaining commanders and advisors. Though Ghislain and Parniel held the real power, as the commander-in-chief, Maurice took the nominal lead in the discussion. “Alright, let’s put aside personal feelings for now and focus on the situation. While the Northern Army has been holding its own, overall, we’re being pushed back, aren’t we?” That much was true. Two enemy legions were still advancing toward the capital. Most pressing was the Delphine Army’s 5th Legion, which had been the first to move eastward and was currently unstoppable. Maurice pointed to the map as he spoke. “Saintess, I believe we need you on the more urgent front…” As his voice trailed off, Ghislain provided an update. “The Northern-Northern Army has already moved to intercept the 4th Legion of the Delphine Army, which breached the southern front.” “Ah, I see! So that just leaves the east. If we can block them there, we’ll have them completely contained!” The plan was simple. While the Northern Army held off one legion, the saintess and her clergy would quickly move east to reinforce the front. Their combined strength would hold the line. Once the Northern Army secured victory and moved eastward, the Delphine forces advancing on the capital would be wiped out. “If that works, this war is practically over!” Though the exact number of Delphine forces remaining in the south was unknown, Maurice felt confident they had seized the advantage. As the group discussed their strategy, a messenger burst in with urgent news. “The Delphine Army’s 5th Legion, advancing in the east, has halted its march!” “What? Why?” Maurice was startled. Could it be that the newly constructed defensive line had stopped them? But the messenger’s response named someone unexpected. “Count Rayfold has made a move!” “Count Rayfold? Amelia? Why would that stop the 5th Legion?” The Delphine Army ravaging the east numbered 50,000 strong. While Rayfold was known to command a formidable force, it was nowhere near that size. The messenger hesitated before replying. “Count Rayfold launched a surprise attack, inflicting significant damage on the Delphine Army. They are currently regrouping.” “Fantastic! Then Count Rayfold must be heading to join the defensive line!” “N-no, that’s not it. Count Rayfold has not joined the line.” “What? Why not? Then what is she doing?” “She fled.” “...What?” “After dealing damage to the Delphine Army, she immediately left the battlefield and…” “And?” “She’s now occupying vacant territories of the lords in the area, claiming them as her own. She says she upheld the agreement by damaging the Delphine Army.” Maurice’s jaw dropped, stunned by what he was hearing. Ghislain, on the other hand, chuckled knowingly, as if he had expected this all along.
