Recently, Amelia found herself in a rather difficult position. After the Duke’s faction withdrew, she had spent several days struggling to stabilize her newly expanded territory. The issue stemmed from the sudden annexation of six counties. Rather than a gradual, prepared expansion, she had seized the opportunity for rapid territorial growth, leaving her with a mountain of problems. The economic state of the eastern regions, already battered by rifts and war, had plummeted to an abysmal level, exacerbating her predicament. Every day, Amelia relentlessly pressured her vassals. If you’ve claimed it, you’re responsible for it. “Is the food transport complete?” “Well, um… there are just so many places that need supplies.” “Didn’t I tell you to focus all our resources on that for now?” “The sudden expansion has left us struggling to even grasp the current situation.” “Tch, I guess we really bit off more than we could chew.” Normally, she would have scolded her complaining vassals without mercy. This time, however, even Amelia couldn’t entirely blame them. While six counties might not sound particularly large, they were prime territories—expansive, fertile lands chosen from the best the east had to offer. In terms of baronies, they exceeded several dozen. Measured by size, her territory was now comparable to the Kingdom of Ceylon. Though it was technically a small kingdom, her lands now rivaled a sovereign nation in scale. Even the annexation of a single territory required significant time to stabilize. This was why Ghislain prioritized stabilization immediately after conquering new lands. No matter how capable she was, attempting to manage such a rapid expansion was bound to overwhelm her. As if things weren’t already challenging enough, another unexpected problem arose—one no one could have foreseen. “What? Marquis Branford has been deposed?” “Yes, Your Majesty has regained his strength, and the lords who lost their lands have all pledged their allegiance to him.” “Hmm…” “The royal court has decreed that the previous agreements are nullified and has ordered all territories returned to their rightful owners. What shall we do?” At this, Amelia scoffed. There was a reason she had gone to such lengths to claim these territories. Opportunities to seize so much land at once were exceedingly rare. However, the nobles who had overseen the agreements stepping down posed a serious headache for her. The royal court was pressuring her incessantly to return the lands and renew her oath of fealty to the king. When Amelia ignored their demands and refrained from replying, they retaliated by blocking the transportation routes connecting Rayfold to the eastern regions. Without the means to reach the north, they simply obstructed the main pathways. “Those bastards…” Amelia ground her teeth in frustration. To stabilize her newly expanded territory, she needed to funnel Rayfold’s resources into the region. Deposing Marquis Branford and splitting the Royal Army from the Northern forces was something she could handle. The problem, however, was the king’s alliance with the Duke’s faction. She had already betrayed the Duke’s faction and become their enemy. Ultimately, she had to make a choice—either fight or concede. As she wrestled with this dilemma, yet another astonishing piece of news arrived. “The Marquis of Ferdium… has rebelled?” “Yes, he’s currently marching on the capital alongside Count Fenris. The Northern Army and other forces have moved to the southern front to block the Duke’s faction.” Amelia smiled, a hint of delight crossing her face. **‘This is an opportunity.’** If the two sides clashed again, she could exploit the situation to her advantage. Before she could make her decision, however, Ghislain’s message arrived. **Flap!** “Hello! I’m here,” said the crow, brazenly entering like an uninvited guest visiting a friend’s house. “….” Amelia’s expression stiffened as she stared at the creature. The crow’s arrival could only mean one thing: Ghislain had another demand for her. “Well… what is it?” “Of course, I’m here to deliver my master’s orders.” “Go on.” “I’ll connect you directly to my master’s consciousness so you can speak with him yourself.” “…Hmph.” As much as she loathed Ghislain’s interference, she couldn’t deny the utility of this spirit. It wasn’t just useful for reconnaissance—it served as an excellent communication tool as well. If she had a similar spirit, she’d make the most of it. A shame she didn’t. After a moment, the crow’s demeanor shifted. “Hey, Amelia. It’s been a while. How’ve you been?” “Don’t act so familiar. Just get to the point.” “So prickly as always… Fine. I’m on my way to seize the capital. I need you to head to the southern front and help delay the Duke’s faction. Make sure they don’t move north.” “….” “Why aren’t you saying anything? Hey, Dark, is the connection stable? Oh, it is? Good.” “….” Amelia watched in silence as the crow spoke to itself. Then, with a cold smile, she finally opened her mouth. “Why should I help you?” The audacity of this man. She had helped him a few times, and now he seemed to think they were on the same side. Ghislain chuckled. “Oh, I’m not asking for free help. You were well-compensated last time, weren’t you? I’ll make sure you’re satisfied again. I hate working for free.” Amelia’s interest was piqued. “Alright. If stopping the Duke’s faction ensures your capture of the capital, what’s the reward?” “I’ll help you stabilize your territory. I’ll send plenty of food and supplies after taking the capital.” “Hm…” It was an enticing offer, but it still felt insufficient. “That’s something I could solve with time.” “If the Duke’s faction marches north, you won’t have time. Even if the Northern Army holds them back, a prolonged war will make it difficult to secure such resources.” Amelia’s lips curled into a cold smirk. Ghislain truly knew how to exploit her weaknesses. Still, she was curious why he was so desperate to involve her. “Wouldn’t the southern front forces be enough to stall them? Why do you need my help?” “Well, first, to minimize losses. With your abilities, you’ll make a significant impact.” “And the second?” “I don’t want you scheming behind my back. It’d be annoying. You’re probably already thinking of ways to exploit the situation.” “….” Amelia chuckled silently. He knew her too well. Ghislain’s tone turned more serious. “My goal is to eliminate the Duke’s faction and the Salvation Order. I don’t want unnecessary distractions or losses.” “So?” “If you refuse, I’ll come for your head this time. As soon as I seize the capital, I’ll head straight for the east.” “You… dare…” “Choose. I know fighting you would be troublesome, and I’d suffer losses. But I can’t leave you unchecked while facing the Duke’s faction.” **Crunch.** Amelia ground her teeth. Once again, Ghislain was using threats and coercion to exploit her strength. She understood his intentions. With the Kingdom’s foremost swordsman involved, the time for a decisive confrontation had come. Ghislain saw her as a potential threat. In other words, this was her last chance to align with him. “….” Amelia remained silent for a long time, her face cold and unyielding. Ghislain waited without saying anything. Even the crow, Dark, averted its eyes under her icy gaze. **‘What’s with these two and their staring contests…’** Despite her fury, Amelia’s mind was racing. She needed to figure out how to turn the situation to her advantage. **‘As much as he says, it’d be a burden for him to come here.’** Ghislain was in a hurry to head south. Fighting her here would only benefit the Duke’s faction. He wouldn’t want that. Still, she couldn’t outright refuse. She knew Ghislain well enough to understand he was unpredictable and willing to take risks. **‘He has more to protect now, but… he’s still capable of doing something reckless.’** He might just attack her, accepting the losses. A compromise was necessary. Their relationship had always been a precarious balancing act, reflecting just how much he needed her power. **‘Could it be…’** A realization dawned on Amelia, and she slowly nodded. The forces on the southern front were enough to hinder the Duke’s faction. Even if she schemed, Ghislain could manage without her. After all, the Ferdium and Royal Armies remained in the capital. So why did he insist on her involvement? It wasn’t just about minimizing losses; he must have plans to use her for something else. Amelia had a faint idea of what he was after. “In that case, you must have more to offer. This can’t be the end of it.” Ghislain laughed. She truly was sharp. “Of course, there’s more. Let’s discuss what’s ahead.” After a brief conversation, the crow left, and Amelia immediately gathered her troops, heading for the southern front. A new ambition burned in her heart as she rode out. *** "Command will be handed over to me." “…Understood.” Having been informed by Ghislain in advance, Gillian willingly transferred command to Amelia. Her capabilities were already well-known, so no one raised objections. From that moment, the nature of the battle began to shift. “Baron Valois, take charge of the right wall.” “Yes, understood.” Amelia’s first move was to reorganize all defensive positions. She had specifically brought in Baron Valois, who had surrendered after Davern’s death, for this purpose. Renowned for his unmatched defensive capabilities, he lived up to expectations, effectively holding off the Delphine forces. However, Amelia wasn’t planning to merely hold out. The enemy’s numbers and strength were too overwhelming. To minimize losses and buy time, she needed to weaken their forces further. “You dwarves were the ones who planted those strange stakes last time, weren’t you?” At her question, Galbaric and the dwarves avoided her gaze, their eyes darting nervously. They remembered how they had previously hindered Amelia’s advance by planting stakes in the ground, even engraving messages like: **“Crafted by the Great Blacksmith and Friends.”** Fearing retaliation, they braced for the worst. But Amelia merely chuckled and issued a new command. “From now on, dig tunnels. Any manpower shortages will be filled by the Rayfold forces.” “W-What?” “Just do as you’re told.” With reinforcements bolstering the workforce, the construction proceeded without issues. The dwarves diligently dug tunnels as instructed. Kaien, leading the Delphine forces, soon noticed the change in their tactics. “The enemy’s strategy has shifted.” As the battle dragged on, fatigue began to wear down both attackers and defenders. Cumulative losses steadily mounted. Yet, the enemy’s casualties seemed to decrease with time. Their movements, once rough and ferocious, had become precise and calculated—almost like a well-oiled machine. This meticulous approach proved far more effective for defense. “This is troublesome.” Though his forces included over ten superhumans, the enemy’s superhumans exhibited abilities so extraordinary that they were difficult to overpower. Their overwhelming divine power continuously healed their troops, while summoned spirits disrupted attacks. Even though the enemy’s superhumans fought alongside their soldiers, focusing solely on defense, this coordination made them nearly impenetrable. Meanwhile, news continued to filter in about Royal Army units surrendering to the Ferdium forces. Kaien’s frustration mounted. After several days of tense stalemate, a mage reported to him. “The fortress’s interior has been obscured from view. It seems the enemy has dedicated their magical forces entirely to blocking visibility.” In large-scale battles, hundreds of mages typically participated, with some tasked with monitoring the opposing camp through magic. Even when countered by interference spells, gaps in coverage were inevitable. However, now the enemy’s camp was almost completely concealed. “Hmm…” Kaien deliberated briefly before issuing a command. “Prepare for a night raid.” There were only a few reasons why defenders would obscure their movements. The most likely explanation was a planned nighttime assault. Sure enough, as Kaien anticipated, cavalry archers emerged under cover of night to strike the Delphine camp’s flank. “Attack!” The waiting forces immediately intercepted them. The startled cavalry archers fled in disarray. While chasing them down, another commotion erupted elsewhere. **Boom! Boom! BOOM!** “What’s happening now?!” Kaien was startled by the sudden uproar in the rear. A soldier hurriedly arrived to report. “Enemy mages have appeared in our rear!” “What? How?” “They seem to have dug tunnels!” Kaien was dumbfounded. It was unheard of for defenders, not attackers, to employ tunneling tactics. The reserve forces stationed at the rear were caught off guard by the surprise attack. Though the enemy quickly withdrew after their initial success, the disruption was a significant blow. “Those bastards…” The enemy’s bold maneuvers forced Kaien to strengthen rear defenses. Attempts to use the tunnels against the enemy were thwarted—they had already been securely sealed. “Sigh… For a defending force, they’re astonishingly aggressive.” Despite having the advantage in defensive positioning, Amelia’s troops actively launched offensive operations, which strained the Delphine forces. Amelia’s tactics seemed almost reckless. Her troops suddenly utilized hot air balloons to launch arrows and spells in the dead of night or prowled the perimeter during raids. Surprisingly, these tactics were effective. The Delphine forces grew increasingly tense, their nerves frayed. Amelia was a master of psychological warfare. Kaien, however, didn’t remain passive. He reorganized his formations and efficiently deployed patrols, curbing Amelia’s guerrilla tactics. But this prolonged engagement came at a cost: too much time had passed. “The capital has been seized!” The report made Kaien clench his teeth in frustration. Count Fenris, the mobile forces, the Ferdium army, and the Royal Army were now marching south. Once they joined forces, the Delphine army would be at a disadvantage. The decisive moment had to come before that. Kaien turned to Gatros. “We must engage immediately, regardless of the casualties.” “Agreed. I’ll instruct the priests to prepare for the worst.” The Delphine forces’ strategy shifted dramatically. They directed all their strength toward breaching a single wall, focusing their trebuchets and magical forces there. **Boom! Boom! BOOM!** Even as Amelia’s forces concentrated on defending the targeted wall, other areas were swarmed by soldiers climbing like relentless specters. Faced with such intensity, Amelia made a bold decision. “Move all stone, wood, and other heavy materials to the targeted wall. Consider them expendable.” Temporary barricades were erected behind the wall, and Amelia pulled back her forces. With reinforcements shoring up other defenses, casualties decreased, and the situation became more manageable. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** The wall under attack inevitably began to crumble. Even the magical forces previously stationed there had been withdrawn. **CRASH!** Eventually, the wall collapsed under the concentrated assault. Although the Delphine forces were temporarily halted by the debris barricade, it was only a matter of time before they broke through. Kaien, observing the stacked barricade, smirked coldly. “By tomorrow, we’ll break through. I’ll slaughter them all.” Though the barricade was substantial, superhumans could dismantle it within a day. Without a wall, their victory seemed assured. Amelia, however, had anticipated this. “We’re abandoning the fortress and retreating to the next one. Draw the enemy deeper.” Following her orders, Amelia’s forces silently withdrew under the cover of night. The next morning, Kaien rejoiced at the discovery. “Excellent! Pursue the enemy!” The next fortress was much smaller, barely large enough to accommodate Amelia’s forces. This also meant it was poorly defensible and likely to collapse after a few attacks. The Delphine forces eagerly pursued the retreating Northern Army, eventually encircling them at the smaller fortress. “What are the enemy’s movements?” “They’re continuing south, but their large numbers make their advance slow. It’ll take at least a week.” “Then we’ll capture this fortress within two days and annihilate them.” It wouldn’t be easy. The Northern Army was formidable, but Kaien believed in his advantage. His superhumans outnumbered the enemy’s, and his troops were superior. “Attack!” **Boom! Boom! BOOM!** The Northern Army seemed barely able to defend the fortress. Its small size and weak structure prevented any effective counterattacks. Kaien pressed the advantage relentlessly. Meanwhile, Amelia observed the situation and nodded in satisfaction. “He’s not just strong; his troop management is impressive.” Kaien had adapted quickly, minimizing losses after initial setbacks and knowing precisely when to strike. If this continued, Amelia’s forces would suffer heavy losses. Yet she smiled. “I think I’ve done enough.” She had bought all the time Ghislain needed. The Ferdium and Royal Armies were still far off, but Fenris’s mobile troops, famed for their unmatched speed, were a different story. Looking up, Amelia spotted a crow circling above. “Such a convenient messenger.” If only she could have one herself. What a shame. As Amelia leisurely watched the unfolding battle, the Delphine forces intensified their assault. At this rate, the fortress would fall within two days. Kaien’s fiery gaze was fixed on the crumbling fortress when a dust-covered messenger arrived. “What is it? What’s happened?” “C-Count Fenris…” “Count Fenris? Has the mobile force arrived?” “N-No, sir.” “Then what? Speak quickly!” Terrified by Kaien’s harsh tone, the messenger stammered. “They’ve bypassed the front line and headed for Mowbray County! They’re marching directly on the Duke’s territory!” Ghislain had fulfilled his earlier promise to Mowbray County’s lord, rescuing his son Edwin and securing safe passage. True to his word, the lord had opened the way. Kaien’s face hardened at the unexpected news. With all forces committed to the front line, their base was now exposed to attack.
