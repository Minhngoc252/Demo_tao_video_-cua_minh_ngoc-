Judge Gatros’s decision to delegate authority to the various commanders rather than stubbornly taking complete control himself was a commendable move. Few people have the ability to assess their own limits objectively without overestimating their capabilities. While this was likely the best option, dispersing command caused small cracks to appear in the cohesion of the Delphine forces. This was inevitable due to the sheer size of the army. “Hmm, are we moving along smoothly?” During their retreat to the fortress, Gatros repeatedly glanced over his shoulder, his expression uneasy. Something about the march felt off. One of his adjutants standing nearby replied, “It’s due to the scale of our forces. The varying speeds of each unit might be causing some irregularities.” “I see. Will this be an issue?” The adjutant paused, hesitant. The uneven march formation was indeed a serious concern. Not only did it prevent the army from achieving full combat effectiveness, but it also made coordinated movements between units impossible. Strategically, this meant they couldn’t fight as a unified force. However, at the moment, they weren’t engaged in battle. “There’s no immediate threat, so I don’t believe we need to worry too much.” “Very well. It shouldn’t be a major problem,” Gatros said dismissively. Since the enemy reinforcements hadn’t yet arrived, he believed there was no imminent danger. Their only task was to reach the fortress and fortify their defenses. Amelia, standing atop the fortress walls, had been observing the Delphine army’s formation closely. A slight sneer appeared on her lips as she assessed their movement. “It’s a mess.” The further back in the formation, the more disorganized the march became. With no single commander overseeing the entire army, it was natural for such chaos to arise. Each of the Delphine commanders was too preoccupied with managing their own units. The differences in troop types between units led to inevitable gaps as the slower-moving divisions fell behind. Gone was the precision and unity of the large army that had once moved seamlessly under Kaien’s command. Turning to Gillian, who stood beside her, Amelia spoke. “Equip them lightly. While the cavalry archers harass and slow the enemy, the rest will form ranks and follow.” Marching wasn’t merely about walking. It required maintaining maximum combat readiness under a superior’s command. That’s why a general’s ability to manage troops during a march was often seen as a measure of their skill. Now, with the Delphine army’s formation unraveling, it was the perfect time for an ambush. **Thud, thud, thud, thud!** The fortress gates opened, and Lumina led the cavalry archers forward. Behind them, a flood of soldiers surged out. Although they were collectively referred to as the Northern Army, this force was now a combination of the allied forces, western troops, and local lords’ militias. Their numbers had grown to exceed those of the Delphine army. “Move out.” At Amelia’s command, the massive force began pursuing the Delphine army. To increase their mobility, they left behind the supply units and heavy equipment. The soldiers carried only rations and water supplied by Fenris, ensuring they could move quickly. **Thud, thud, thud, thud!** The highly mobile cavalry archers rapidly closed the distance to the rear of the Delphine army. Gatros was caught off guard by the sudden appearance of the cavalry archers. “What is this? Are they trying to fight us now?” His adjutant was equally shocked. If they had any sense of self-preservation, they wouldn’t have made such a move. The cavalry archers numbered only about 10,000. Gatros, feeling insulted, barked out an order. “Attack them! Kill those fools!” The Delphine army turned to engage. However, the attack couldn’t be executed immediately. The uneven march formation and the slower-moving infantry at the rear had created a significant gap. As the infantry scrambled to reposition, the 10,000 cavalry archers unleashed a volley of arrows. **Swish!** “Argh!” “Raise your shields! Block them!” “Just hold on! Reinforcements will come from behind!” The heavily armored soldiers at the very rear were relatively unharmed. However, the light infantry marching ahead of them suffered significant losses. Grinding his teeth, Gatros shouted. “Archers! Mages! Counterattack now! What are the priests doing?!” The Delphine army’s elite warriors scrambled to respond. Meanwhile, Lumina, drawing her bow again, recalled Amelia’s command. **– Only twice.** “Twice…” **Swish!** Another volley of arrows rained down. Without hesitation, Lumina turned her horse and ordered a retreat. “Pull back!” The cavalry archers quickly reversed direction, widening the distance between themselves and the Delphine army. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** Lightning struck, fireballs rained from the sky, and dark pillars of energy erupted. The Delphine archers fired a counter-volley that blackened the heavens. But the cavalry archers, having already fled beyond range, suffered no casualties. They had exploited a brief window before the enemy could fully mobilize. Lumina clicked her tongue as she retreated. **Impressive.** Amelia had perfectly calculated the time it would take for the Delphine forces to counterattack based on the intelligence she had gathered from their previous battles. The Delphine army, thrown into disarray by the sudden rear assault, struggled to reorganize. Chasing the cavalry archers was out of the question. Their formation was already in shambles. Fortunately, their supply units remained intact at the front, sparing them further logistical complications. Grinding his teeth, Gatros convened his commanders. “They’re trying to slow us down with these petty tricks. Strengthen the rear guard and prepare for further ambushes.” “Understood.” The Delphine army reformed its ranks and tended to their wounded. They placed heavy infantry at the rear while positioning their mages, archers, and priests slightly closer to the back for better coverage. Though it was a standard response, it inadvertently bought time for the Northern Army to catch up. “What?” “Enemy sighted!” “The Northern Army is here!” Shouts erupted as the Delphine soldiers spotted a massive force closing in from behind. It wasn’t surprising to encounter the enemy again so soon after the cavalry archers’ retreat. Gatros smirked. “Fools! Do they think they can defeat us just because Count Balzac isn’t here?” While Count Balzac’s prowess was undeniable, his absence hadn’t drastically reduced their strength. They still had more superhumans, and their siege tactics had kept the enemy on the defensive. “Charge!” At Gatros’s command, the Delphine army advanced. At the forefront stood priests of the Salvation Order. Gatros had no intention of merely observing. With their forces slightly diminished, he intended to bolster morale with his presence on the battlefield. On the opposite side, Amelia raised her hand, signaling her troops. Following her orders, the Northern Army advanced to meet the Delphine forces. At the rear of the Northern Army, a hastily constructed platform had been erected. Amelia climbed to the top, her sharp gaze surveying the battlefield. “Conrad, neutralize their magical capabilities first.” “Understood.” Her adjutant, Conrad, relayed her command. A magical field spread between the two armies, blocking the use of offensive spells. **“Waaaaah!”** While the mages on both sides were neutralized, the frontline troops clashed. **Boom!** Leading the Northern Army’s vanguard were the heavily armored infantry of Rayfold. True to their elite training, they held their ground firmly. Amelia issued rapid orders. “Relay to the High Chief to take the right flank.” “The Saintess will lead the left flank.” “Gillian and Tenant will support the Saintess with the western troops.” “Kaor and the assault team will back the High Chief. The cavalry archers will provide cover from behind.” “All allied forces, join the Rayfold infantry at the front and maintain pressure. Do not let them falter.” The soldiers moved without hesitation, following Amelia’s commands. Watching their swift response, she smirked. “They’re quick to react.” The Fenris troops, trained to perfection under Ghislain’s leadership, executed her orders immediately. They were thus entrusted with the flanking maneuvers. The allied forces, though slower, were numerous. Joining the Rayfold infantry, they used their sheer numbers to hold back the Delphine army. Some of the newly allied lords begrudged Amelia’s leadership, but the importance of the battle compelled them to comply. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** “Kill them!” “Hold the line! Don’t let them through!” “Push forward!” This was the largest clash since the civil war began. With over 150,000 Delphine soldiers and 200,000 Northern Army troops, the battlefield erupted into chaos. At first glance, the forces seemed evenly matched. While the Northern Army had more soldiers, the allied forces and western troops were less disciplined than the Delphine army. However, Gatros had overlooked one critical factor. “What the—?! Why are we being surrounded?!” The Delphine army’s flanks were collapsing. Even Gatros, with his limited knowledge of military strategy, quickly realized what was happening. “The cavalry! They’re concentrated on the flanks!” Nearly half of the Delphine cavalry had followed Count Balzac, leaving their forces weakened in mobility. In contrast, the Northern Army, built around cavalry tactics, maintained their numbers. Amelia’s superior cavalry units relentlessly pressured the Delphine flanks. On one side, the cavalry archers continued their persistent harassment. The Delphine archers couldn’t spare resources to counter them, as they were busy defending against attacks from three directions. **Boom!** “Argh!” With their formation already disrupted, the Delphine army couldn’t move cohesively. Both flanks were rapidly being encircled. Attempts to break through the front were thwarted by the Rayfold infantry and allied forces, who held firm with their superior numbers and discipline. Supporting the frontlines were formidable warriors like Bernaph and Vulcan, who prevented any breach. “Priests! Assist them!” Gatros shouted desperately. But even the priests struggled to intervene. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** On the left, the High Chief Ereneth and the Saintess Parniel were wreaking havoc. The priests of the Salvation Order focused their efforts on targeting enemy superhumans, knowing they couldn’t withstand the ferocity of the Saintess for long. “Kill her!” Three priests charged at Parniel. **Crash!** The first priest was sent flying by a massive blow from her mace. “You wretched woman!” Another priest tried to strike her from the side, but Parniel easily blocked with her thick forearm, retaliating with a headbutt. **Boom!** The sound of the impact was deafening. The priest staggered, momentarily dazed. **Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!** Knights supporting Parniel immediately plunged their swords into the fallen priest. A third priest attempted to stop them, but Parniel intercepted. **Boom!** A powerful energy attack from the priest struck her directly in the stomach. “You... monster…” The priest’s face twisted in disbelief. Despite the devastating attack, Parniel only bent slightly, a thin line of blood trailing from her lips. She seemed otherwise unfazed. Her mace swung through the air, shattering the ground as it descended upon the priest. **Crash!** “Arghhh!” The priest, attempting to block the blow, had his arms crushed. This was why the Saintess inspired fear. Her divine energy, diametrically opposed to the Salvation Order, gave her unparalleled power against their priests. Her strength earned her the title of the Fourth Strongest of the Continent during the Era of Calamity. Even three priests couldn’t hold her back. With the superhumans tied down, Gillian and Tenant led the cavalry in a devastating charge against the Delphine army’s left flank. **Boom!** “Arghhh!” The Delphine forces’ flank was completely breached. Without coordination, they couldn’t repel the attack. Gatros was at a loss. Each commander was doing their best, evidenced by their ability to hold their ground despite the circumstances. But they were only directing their individual units. No one was managing the battlefield as a whole. “This... can’t be…” As Gatros struggled to decide where to intervene, he hesitated. He had initially intended to reinforce the Saintess’s location, but two more priests had already been sent there, only to be intercepted by Gillian and Tenant. Even as his army crumbled, Gatros couldn’t move in that direction. **Boom!** The chaos on the other side of the battlefield was no less severe.
