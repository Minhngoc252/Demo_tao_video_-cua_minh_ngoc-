"Arghhh!" "Neighhh!" "Hold the line! Move, damn it!" "Form up! Keep your ranks!" The Atrodé Army was in utter chaos, all thanks to the unexpected intrusion of Ghislain Fenris. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** As soon as Ghislain breached the frontlines, he mercilessly swung his spear, cutting down soldiers and scattering mana-infused spears all around. Horses reared in panic, soldiers stumbled and fell, and the Atrodé Army’s formation crumbled with terrifying speed—all because of one man. Count Jairus wiped the cold sweat from his brow. "This madman...!" He had heard rumors of Ghislain's ferocity, but to see him charge alone into enemy lines like this was beyond comprehension. The Fenris Cavalry hadn’t even arrived yet. Jairus needed to regroup and charge before they showed up, but Ghislain wasn’t giving him a chance. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** Ghislain spun his spear like a whirlwind, sweeping away soldiers as he tore through the ranks. His actions were nothing short of insanity, yet devastatingly effective. Adding to the chaos was his monstrous steed, the Black King. **Neighhh!** With every kick of its hind legs, enemy soldiers were sent flying, their chests caving in on impact. The horse and rider moved as if in perfect sync, amplifying each other’s destructive power. In truth, the Black King had grown even stronger. While it couldn’t actively use mana, Ghislain had been steadily feeding it small amounts, allowing its body to store mana and bolster its strength over time. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** Jairus, his voice hoarse from shouting, bellowed at his men, "Regroup the lines! Spread out! Where the hell are the priests?!" Infantry, even amidst chaos, could adapt tactically. Cavalry, however, were useless if they couldn’t move freely. They needed space to maneuver, but Ghislain’s rampage made that impossible. Finally, the priests pushed forward, unleashing a burst of energy despite knowing it would harm their own allies. **KABOOM!** The explosion sent soldiers and debris flying, but it succeeded in temporarily surrounding Ghislain. Lowering his spear, Ghislain smirked at the priests. "Oh? You’re finally here. Took you long enough." Before the priests could respond, the Fenris Cavalry arrived. **KABOOM!** "Arghhh!" The Atrodé Army, already disorganized, stood no chance against the onslaught. The Fenris Cavalry plowed through their lines, leaving devastation in their wake. Leading the charge were the Fenris knights, whose skill had now reached mid-to-high levels of mastery. "Let’s go!" bellowed Paladin Gordon, his voice booming. Despite lacking divine power, he fought with overwhelming brute strength. Lukas, another senior knight, demonstrated his rapidly advancing skills. **Boom! Boom! Boom!** The Atrodé Army was being crushed with alarming ease. For a force that had conquered the Kingdom of Grimwell, their current performance was pitiful. This was all thanks to Ghislain, who had disrupted their formation and drawn all attention to himself. The priests, now visibly panicking, realized the severity of the situation. If this continued, their army would be annihilated. "Kill him!" one of them shouted. "We have to take down Fenris!" **KABOOM!** The battle intensified as four priests engaged Ghislain in combat. Meanwhile, the Fenris Cavalry continued to decimate the Atrodé forces. The priests, desperate and running out of options, poured out their energy in a bid to overpower Ghislain. However, their dark energy was effortlessly deflected by his crimson spear. "Not bad," Ghislain remarked, raising an eyebrow. These priests were far stronger than any he had faced before, and their combined techniques were formidable enough to challenge even seasoned superhumans. Still, they were no match for Ghislain. **SWOOSH!** Activating the third stage of his Core, Ghislain's spear glowed with an intense crimson hue. The sheer force behind his strikes multiplied several times over. **BOOM!** In a flash, one priest’s heart was pierced. The attack was so swift and devastating that he had no time to react. Despite the loss, the remaining priests seized the opportunity to counterattack. **CRACK! CRACK!** Their dark energy lashed out, only to be parried and deflected by Ghislain's spear with surgical precision. His speed and accuracy left the priests reeling. **BOOM!** With a sound like thunder, Ghislain’s spear pierced another priest’s throat, tearing through his neck with such force that it exploded. Behind him, the Black King reared and lashed out, its hooves crushing the chest of another priest attempting to flank Ghislain. "Urgh!" The injured priest stumbled back, astonished. The warhorse struck with the strength of a knight, moving with terrifying precision. As the battle raged on, the last two priests clenched their jaws in frustration. "How can a horse be this ferocious?" "And Fenris himself... we underestimated him." Though they had known he was strong, this level of dominance was beyond anything they had prepared for. He had already slain two of them, and it was clear they couldn’t last much longer. With no other choice, the priests began burning their own life force to amplify their power. **WHOOOOOOM!** Ghislain, noticing the shift, widened his eyes slightly. "Oh? Burning your life force? Now that’s rare." It was a reckless move, but it underscored their desperation. "Fenris!" one of them shouted. "We’ll take you with us, even if it kills us!" **KABOOM!** The priests’ combined power surged to extraordinary levels. However, Ghislain remained mounted, calmly shielding the Black King while continuing to fight. For him, this battle was just another form of training. **CRACK! BOOM!** Watching the carnage, Count Jairus felt paralyzed by despair. Cavalry alone couldn’t turn the tide. The priests had to defeat Fenris, or they were doomed. But deep down, Jairus knew the truth. Fenris hadn’t even dismounted, and he had already slain two priests. There was no chance he would lose to the remaining two. Realizing their predicament, Jairus barked out his last-ditch orders. "Hold on! Just hold out! The Second Corps will come for us!" The Atrodé Army still had 30,000 soldiers, enough to drag the battle out and buy time for reinforcements. As long as they could delay, they had a sliver of hope. "Send word to the Second Corps! Run—now!" Jairus’s guards moved to deliver the message, but they never made it. **KABOOM!** A pillar of fire erupted behind the Atrodé Army, engulfing the fleeing messengers. Vanessa, who had accompanied the Fenris Cavalry, had been lying in wait. Rather than join the melee, she focused on cutting off all escape routes with her devastating magic. Jairus stared in disbelief. "Magic? How...? Why didn’t we notice?" Despite the Atrodé mages deploying mana barriers, Vanessa’s magic had broken through with ease. The realization hit him like a hammer: the Fenris side had at least one 7th-Circle mage. They had been utterly unprepared. "No... this can’t be..." With no reinforcements and no way to retreat, the Atrodé Army’s fate was sealed. As the battle continued, the overwhelming skill, strength, and coordination of the Fenris forces crushed any remaining hope. The Atrodé soldiers fought, but despair was etched into their every move. **CLANG! SLASH!** The Fenris knights and cavalry cut through the enemy ranks like a relentless tide, their dominance unquestionable. Even amidst the chaos, Lukas and Gordon exchanged their usual banter. "Hey, crybaby. You’ve improved a lot," Gordon teased. "Shut up! I’m a holy knight personally appointed by the Saintess herself!" Lukas snapped. "More like a vulgar knight," Gordon retorted, smirking as they both dispatched enemy after enemy. The Fenris knights, honed by brutal training and countless battles, displayed unparalleled prowess. Even with only 200 knights on the field, they seemed capable of slaughtering thousands. The Atrodé soldiers, though still fighting, were gripped by an overwhelming sense of doom. **Clang! Ting! Ting!** “Damn it! Our weapons can’t penetrate!” “Find an opening! Attack the horse if you have to and bring him down!” “How is he moving like that in full plate armor?!” The Galvanium armor worn by the Fenris forces boasted unparalleled defensive capabilities. The standard infantry's weapons couldn't even scratch it. To make matters worse, the armor was so light that the Fenris Cavalry moved with the agility of soldiers wearing light armor. Their speed and precision made them seem untouchable. The only way to counter them was to tire them out and overwhelm them with sheer numbers. But such a strategy required multiple soldiers focusing on a single enemy—an impossible task given the current chaotic state of the battlefield. For the Atrodé Army, it felt like slamming into an impenetrable wall. **Crack! Crack! Crack!** Soldiers fell one after another, bleeding out as they succumbed to the relentless attacks of the Fenris knights and cavalry. The Atrodé knights tried to hold their ground, only to be completely overrun by the overwhelming skill and numbers of their enemies. The battle began to shift from a fierce skirmish to a one-sided massacre. **“Grrrgh…”** Even so, the Atrodé soldiers fought on, desperately trying to resist the Fenris Cavalry and inflict some damage in return. Their pride and the years of experience they had accumulated fueled their determination to keep fighting, even in the face of insurmountable odds. They were, without a doubt, the elite of the Atrodé Army. From his position, Ghislain watched their struggle even as he clashed with the priests. He had deliberately orchestrated this situation to observe the true capabilities of the Atrodé Army’s core forces. Without the Galvanium equipment, his forces would likely have suffered significant losses. Despite their disadvantage, the Atrodé soldiers demonstrated remarkable discipline and grit in their attempts to hold the line. “Well, I suppose it’s time to end this,” Ghislain muttered. Ghislain clenched his jaw, drawing on his mana as he prepared to unleash his full power. **BOOM!** “Argh!” One of the priests fighting him was struck by the shaft of his spear and sent flying sideways. Without missing a beat, Ghislain thrust his spear toward the remaining priest. **CLANG!** The priest barely managed to block the attack, having burned his own life force to boost his strength. But Ghislain wasn’t done. **Clang! Clang! Clang!** The spear moved with blinding speed, creating the illusion of hundreds of strikes. The priest desperately tried to defend, but it was impossible to block them all. **BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!** Every missed block allowed the spear to pierce through flesh. The priest’s shoulder, abdomen, neck, and thigh were ruthlessly impaled one after another. “Urgh…” It happened in an instant. Despite his best efforts, the priest couldn’t withstand the relentless assault. As he collapsed, riddled with wounds, another priest charged at Ghislain. “You bastard!” The priest was both enraged and terrified. Deep down, he knew he had no chance of defeating Ghislain alone. The gap in skill was simply too vast, and his shaken resolve made it impossible to launch an effective attack. **BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!** **Thud!** In the end, the priest’s clumsy attacks were easily deflected. He barely lasted a few moments before Ghislain’s spear pierced his head, ending his life. “Haa…” Ghislain exhaled deeply. To the onlookers, it may have seemed like he had defeated the priests effortlessly, but the truth was far from that. The third stage of his Core Amplification consumed a significant amount of mana. Although his current strength allowed him to maintain it for longer periods, it still placed considerable strain on his body. Moreover, the four priests he had faced were noticeably stronger than any he had encountered before. Turning his attention to the rear, Ghislain raised his hand and signaled to Vanessa and the mages who had been waiting patiently. Vanessa acknowledged his signal, breaking through the enemy's mana barrier to unleash her magic. **BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!** A massive pillar of fire erupted at the rear of the Atrodé Army, engulfing fleeing soldiers. Though the power of her magic was slightly reduced due to the mana barrier, it was more than enough to obliterate the disorganized troops. “Arghhh!” Already on the brink of collapse, the Atrodé Army could do nothing against the magical onslaught. Even the enemy mages who had been maintaining the mana barrier were incinerated, reduced to ashes. “Run! Run and tell someone—anyone—what’s happening here!” Count Jairus shouted desperately, tears of blood streaming down his face. But before any of the remaining soldiers could flee, Ghislain pointed his spear forward. “Don’t let a single one escape.”
