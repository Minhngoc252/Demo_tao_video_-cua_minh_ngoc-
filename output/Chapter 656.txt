“Ah... finally, I feel alive again...” Julien lay sprawled on the bed, his face buried in the pillow. Deneb did the same. Kyle, having passed out earlier, was now snoring loudly, completely lost to the world. Ghislain hadn’t booked multiple rooms at the inn. Instead, he rented a single large room where everyone could stay together. Deneb glanced at Ghislain and asked cautiously, “It’s been a while since we had a proper rest. Couldn’t we at least get separate rooms?” “No.” “But we have plenty of money right now!” “Your behavior has been suspicious lately.” “...” “It’s like you’re trying to avoid me.” “...” “Here, you can’t hide anything. So rest properly.” Deneb sighed deeply. Ghislain wasn’t giving them any chance to run away. While he could probably track them down even if they fled, Ghislain preferred to avoid such a situation altogether. Besides, Astion’s body had proven to be surprisingly more convenient than his original one. Still, thanks to the treasures they had amassed after defeating countless fanatics, they could finally indulge in some luxury. After washing up, the three, now refreshed and clean, were stunned to see an enormous feast laid out before them. Kyle looked at Ghislain with sparkling eyes. “Wow! Is all of this really for us?” Ghislain nodded. “Of course. Eating well is part of your training. Proper meals help your body recover and build strength.” “...” The group was left speechless, overwhelmed by how nothing in their lives seemed exempt from training. It felt like they had enlisted in the military. Thinking back to the storage room Ghislain had bragged about, Julien cautiously asked, “Were you a soldier, Ghislain?” “Well, I’ve commanded soldiers on the battlefield, so I guess you could say that.” The three nodded as if they had expected that answer. Unlike nobles who only pretended to participate in wars, Ghislain’s teachings about the fundamentals of combat and strategy were genuinely professional. “Yeah, I’m never joining the military,” Kyle muttered. They all resolved inwardly to continue wandering the world and helping people. “If we make enough money, we’ll live quietly,” each of them silently vowed, oblivious to what the future held. But that was the future. For now, in the present, freshly bathed and warm, they devoured the spicy food set before them. “This is delicious!” Tears streamed down their faces. It had been a long time since they’d eaten food this warm and flavorful. The grueling training they’d endured made the meal taste even better. Thanks to Ghislain’s benevolence, they could finally rest without worrying about weapons or supplies. He had used their wealth effectively to provide them this comfort. When the trio tried to complain about the expense, Ghislain shut them down firmly. “When you spend money, do it properly. If the goal is rest, focus all resources on rest.” With that logic, they had nothing left to argue about. Kyle mumbled through a mouthful of food, “Money really is the best.” In the end, even their desire to grow stronger came down to earning money. With money, they could eat well and rest comfortably. Neither Julien nor Deneb could deny this truth. As their meal neared its end, Ghislain turned to Deneb and asked the question that had been on his mind. “Your divine power isn’t particularly strong... but it doesn’t seem like enough of a reason for you to have been cast out, does it?” Deneb lowered her head, her face tinged with embarrassment. “Divine power can only forgive sins if it’s strong enough. Back then, no matter how much I prayed, my sins couldn’t be absolved.” “...But now it’s diminished a bit?” “Yes. I think it’s because I’ve been training continuously.” “Isn’t divine power supposed to be static?” “Not necessarily. If someone spends their entire life doing good deeds and training, it can increase slightly.” Even so, the increase was usually negligible, which is why almost no one lived such a life. Still, Deneb believed her situation was a rare exception. Divine power was most likely to grow during childhood, although even then, such cases were rare. The temple took children in based on the slim possibility of growth. Deneb had been cast out when it became clear she had no further potential. Ghislain pondered her words briefly, then nodded. “Alright, rest well today. Tomorrow, let’s explore the outskirts.” Rather than respond, the trio silently continued eating, savoring the rare moment of peace. It had been so long since they’d been able to enjoy a meal with such ease. The next morning, Ghislain led the group on a tour. Seeing Julien and Deneb’s brightened expressions put him at ease. After a quick look around the city, Ghislain headed toward the poorer residential areas. Most of the houses were crumbling, and the people wandering the streets looked exhausted and worn down. As he observed the scene, Ghislain muttered, “Since we’re here, why don’t we do some charity work?” The trio’s eyes widened in surprise. They weren’t used to hearing such words from Ghislain. Even Julien gave him a suspicious look. Ghislain noticed Julien’s reaction and flinched. “What’s wrong?” Seeing Julien, who usually jumped at any chance to help others, now looking at him like this, made Ghislain wonder if his harsh training methods had warped him. “Did I ruin their sense of charity?” Of course, Julien wasn’t corrupted. He was simply too tired and caught off guard by the unexpected suggestion of volunteer work. Still, if things continued like this, who knew what might happen. Deneb smiled brightly and said, “Yes, let’s help the people. We have plenty of money to spare.” She was overjoyed by Ghislain’s suggestion. Helping those in need was her lifelong dream and goal—not an excuse to escape training, she assured herself. The group purchased food and supplies in bulk and distributed them to the people in the slums. At first, the residents hesitated, unsure how to respond, but soon they began expressing their gratitude and accepting the goods. More and more people gathered as time went on. Julien, ever mindful, ensured they didn’t distribute everything at once. He carefully calculated to ensure the supplies reached as many people as possible. Kyle glanced at Julien’s expression and asked, “We still have enough. Let’s keep going for a bit longer. Is that okay, Ghislain?” “Fine. Consider it part of your rest.” Ghislain monitored them with a detached gaze. While the trio worked diligently, he simply observed, preferring not to intervene. This method of direct aid wasn’t his style. He believed in providing opportunities rather than handouts. Without responsibility or value, people often wasted what they were given. Even so, he let the trio do as they wished this time. What mattered was Deneb’s sincerity and the positive impact on the slum dwellers. As more people gathered, Deneb’s face lit up with pride and joy. The happiness she felt while helping others was unmistakable. Amidst the crowd, a young man approached, holding a bottle of water. “Excuse me... Are you a priestess?” “Yes, though I’m still in training. Do you need help?” “My mother is very ill. Please, I beg you, could you take a look at her?” The young man knelt, his voice trembling with desperation. In this era, divine healing was a luxury only the wealthy could afford. Deneb readily accepted his plea, though she added with a shy smile, “My divine power is weak, so I might not be able to help much.” Even so, the young man’s face lit up with hope. Any aid was better than none. Deneb did her best to heal the old woman. Though her divine power was limited, the improvement was visible. “Thank goodness. She should recover further with proper meals and rest.” Deneb handed the young man a small note. “Use this to buy medicinal herbs to strengthen her body. Please take good care of her.” “Thank you... thank you so much.” The young man bowed repeatedly, overwhelmed with gratitude. He had never experienced such kindness before. In a world where helping others was rare, Deneb’s compassion shone brightly. Everyone was so consumed with thoughts of how to take from others that they didn’t consider the consequences. Word quickly spread about Deneb’s ability to use divine power, and before long, sick and injured people from all over began to swarm toward her. “Line up! I’ll help everyone in turn!” From that day forward, Deneb worked tirelessly, sharing her divine power and treating illnesses. Her divine power was limited, and she quickly grew exhausted, yet she pushed herself, pouring every ounce of energy into helping others. Julien and Kyle bought herbs and distributed them among the needy. It was a significant effort to help those in dire circumstances. The recipients often left with grateful smiles while Deneb took a brief moment to rest. However, their goodwill caused a problem. The news of Deneb’s healing ability spread further, and soon, people who didn’t even live in the slums came seeking her divine treatment. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of people and their desperate pleas, Deneb found herself unable to keep up. “Please heal me, too!” “I’ve waited for days—now it’s my turn!” “No, I’m worse off—heal me first!” The slums were filled with people who barely had enough to eat and lived in poor hygiene. Illnesses and injuries were rampant, and everyone was desperate to receive treatment. The situation quickly devolved into chaos as people pushed and shoved, fighting to be first in line. “Move aside! I was here first!” “What are you talking about? I’ve been waiting longer!” “I said I was here first!” The desperation of the crowd grew uglier by the second. No one cared about maintaining order, and there was no one with the authority to control the situation. A small riot began to break out. If this continued, Deneb might be crushed under the weight of the crowd. Julien and Kyle stepped forward nervously. “Hey! Stop! Don’t come any closer!” “Line up, damn it! Get in line!” But the crowd, frantic and desperate, didn’t listen. Divine healing was rare and expensive—this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for many. “Treat me first!” “My father is dying—please, help him now!” “Save my child first—please heal my baby!” Some even came armed, waving weapons as they threatened their way to the front. For people with no certainty about tomorrow, they had no reason to hold back when hope was right in front of them. The trio was at a loss. They had always performed small acts of kindness, but this situation was far beyond what they could handle. They couldn’t ignore the cries for help, nor did they have the resources to meet everyone’s needs. As the chaos escalated, Ghislain stood to the side, watching silently. “To help others is never an easy task. They still have much to learn,” he muttered to himself. Ghislain had seen countless desperate situations in his time, but even he found this era particularly bleak. It wasn’t just the poverty or the broken morality—it was as if the entire foundation of society, its laws, systems, and even people’s thought processes, had crumbled. Deneb, sweating profusely, called out, “P-Please! Everyone, form a line! I’ll see all of you, but you have to wait your turn!” Julien and Kyle supported her, doing their best to keep the crowd from surging closer. Despite their efforts, no one attacked Deneb directly—she was their only hope for treatment. Instead, they turned on one another. “I said I was first, you bastard!” Thud! Violence erupted as someone threw a punch. Fists and curses flew, and the chaos quickly spiraled into a brawl. Deneb turned pale as she watched the crowd descend into madness. “W-Why... Why are they fighting like this?” The situation had become far too dire for her to handle, and Julien and Kyle were equally helpless. Ghislain, however, remained silent, his expression one of quiet curiosity as he observed how the trio would resolve the issue. “Get out of the way, you scum!” “No, you move, idiot!” “You bastard! I’ll kill you!” The fighting grew more intense, with the sick and injured being pushed aside, trampled, and forgotten in the chaos. Angry and frustrated, the people seemed to forget why they were even there in the first place. “Stop! Please, everyone, stop this madness!” Deneb tried desperately to calm them, but her voice was drowned out by the noise. Moving closer to the crowd would only put her in danger. “Step back!” Julien grabbed Deneb by the arm and pulled her away. He wanted to help, but there was nothing he could do against such an unruly mob. As the chaos raged on, a new group arrived from the distance. A man dressed in luxurious priestly robes appeared, flanked by temple knights. The priest surveyed the scene with a disdainful expression and muttered, “Tch, what a disgraceful sight. Clear the way.” At his command, the temple knights moved into action. Their methods were far from gentle. Slash. “Urgh!” Without hesitation, the knights began cutting down the people blocking their path.
